<PRE>What do you think in terms of future design (core, base_translator, standard
implementations etc.)? I'll read through the modules and hope to understand
the bulk. But this may take some time. That said, I would assume it could be
smarter to write down some fairly general specification of the base_class
(to do it top-down), without too much looking at YABT. I say this because I
personally feel I'd like more clarity on the design. You come from somewhere
else, of course, as you know yabt by heart. This gives you a great advantage
in terms of clarity on technical issues. But in an ideal world we would
probably sit down on a hill, relax, draft what we believe would be an ideal
architecture and find out afterwards what's already there. Then we would
either take yabt as it is, because we believe it is ideal, take it and make
some changes, or rewrite it from scratch, because we have found it not ideal
at all. The second alternative seems most likely. You may find this approach
annoying as you seem to know what an ideal translator would do. In my World
though, there is little knowledge on YABT and much room for creativity. At
the risk of wasting everybody's time (in case yabt is ideal), but in the
hope that yabt's architecture leaves some room for enhancement, I attach a
first and incomplete draft specification to be continued or dropped.



Happy to discuss.
