</I>&gt;<i> basis.
</I>May be rule is poorly named, but I felt it fitted as it determines 
whether a translation can occur and how it should occur. Different 
instances of these objects may determine if a translation can occur in 
different ways (even yielding different answers) and may say that the 
translation should be applied in a different way. To me a single 
component, of which there may be many, which decides on if and how to do 
something is a rule. Reflecting on this may be my rule is at a slightly 
different level in the process. I think this difference in assigning 
what is where is better shown else where, read on.
&gt;<i> 1. On the loader concept
</I>&gt;<i> I see your point to the extent that you want a given translator to be 
</I>&gt;<i> abel to use different loaders and vice versa. My only response to the 
</I>&gt;<i> first point would be a dispatcher mechanism either through an 
</I>&gt;<i> (optional) argument to __init__ , or according to the file name 
</I>&gt;<i> extension (eg. xml, csv etc.). The second type of reuse (one loader 
</I>&gt;<i> for different translators) would seem to me an academic exercise but I 
</I>&gt;<i> may be wrong. But even if there are practical needs to reuse a given 
</I>&gt;<i> loader for various translators, I would assume that (multiple) 
</I>&gt;<i> inheritance is the most obvious way to reuse an existing loader. I 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot currently think of a practical need to allow the user to write 
</I>&gt;<i> a new loader complying with a particular translator's loader API. But 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no strong views on this. My only concern is that the loader 
</I>&gt;<i> concept seems somewhat awkward as it requires two steps to load a rule 
</I>&gt;<i> table: create a loader object and then pass it to the translator of 
</I>&gt;<i> your choice. These two steps may be required as you suspect for the 
</I>&gt;<i> future. But today most users would probably wonder what this is all 
</I>&gt;<i> good for. Can you think of a more convenient way, say, through 
</I>&gt;<i> a wrapper, default values for arguments etc.? - I guess the __init__ 
</I>&gt;<i> methods of subclasses would be a good place. I want to instantiate 
</I>&gt;<i> most translators just by giviny passing a filename of my favorite rule 
</I>&gt;<i> table, or even less than that (look at PyHyphen where I can write: 
</I>&gt;<i> h_uk = hyphenator('en_UK'), and the filename is constracted through a 
</I>&gt;<i> simple join. Clearly, this would require a filename convention which I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't think is appropriate here because we won't have a subclass for 
</I>&gt;<i> braille translation, but for, say, translation trees featuring a 
</I>&gt;<i> certain range of rule types.
</I>This raises a few questions:
* The problem that we have no specific translator for Braille, I 
remember Willie Walker in an Orca presentation saying that one piece of 
advice he was given that he feels was good is to not generalise unless 
you have enough cases to require you to generalise. So could we be 
hitting problems because YABT is now &quot;a context sensitive string 
manipulation tool&quot; and so the specific task (originally Braille 
translation) is not focusing what is really wanted? Whether this is 
right or wrong at the moment I am unsure, but working to actual usage 
examples probably would help focus things.
* Loaders: I am unsure whether this is done for users purposes or mine. 
It means that there may be a whole library of rule types and someone 
could develop a table which could make use of a combination of those 
rules never used together before. Whether anyone is going to do that I 
don't know, but it would be nice to be able to say to someone who asks 
for a particular translation system, yes it can be made easily by just 
creating a new loader and then just making that loader for them. The 
other reason I want the loader system is my own purpose. If at some 
point I wish to change the table format (as I feel the existing XML 
format needs to be) then I can leave the existing loader in place 
develop the new loader, test it out my self, then add a way users can 
opt to use it and then in one simple change of code make the new loader 
the default (and all I need to do is sit back and wait for all the 
emails describing all the problems caused by the sudden change).
* Creating a translator in one quick simple single liner, yes YABT 
doesn't do it currently, but does YABT need to change its design or does 
YABT just need another layer, eg. what I have referred to as a config 
module, but may be it would be better called a translator manager 
module, or may be just something else. I haven't really given this layer 
much thought, it may do more of what you call the dispatcher,  or may be 
it would just be a factory module (eg. createTranslator(translatorType, 
tableSource, tableType) (or something like that) which would return a 
translator class pre-loaded with rules from a loader registered for 
processing tableType).
&gt;<i> On rules
</I>&gt;<i> It seems now we are closer than I'd thought yesterday.
</I>&gt;<i> This being said:
</I>&gt;<i> - I feel uncomfortable with that AddCharMapping staff in the 
</I>&gt;<i> base_class as char substitution is too specific. Further, as I wrote, 
</I>&gt;<i> char substitution should be an ordinary rule to be registered with the 
</I>&gt;<i> base class. So may I suggest you use a simple substitution rule fed 
</I>&gt;<i> either by a plain text file (as I suggested yesterday), or by a 
</I>&gt;<i> hard-coded dictionary or list of pairs.
</I>May be AddCharMapping could be changed, it might be addPrepRule(Rule) 
which means that any rule can be added for the preparation stage but 
these should be simple although YABT won't restrict this.
&gt;<i> - What do you mean by GetListOfStates? I believe you cannot always 
</I>&gt;<i> list all possible states as these may be unknown or indefinite. I 
</I>&gt;<i> know: a finite state michine works on a finite number of states... But 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not comfortable with this restriction as I feel a state should be 
</I>&gt;<i> defined not by an integer, but by an object containing multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> settings. Also, the name 'state' suggests that it may only refer to 
</I>&gt;<i> some property of the translator itself. However, I think we agree that 
</I>&gt;<i> state can describe any property of anything in the universe. So I 
</I>&gt;<i> would suggest to replace it by 'settings'.But the structure of 
</I>&gt;<i> settings objects would have to be defined. I guess a settings object 
</I>&gt;<i> would be a simple empty container that could store all kinds of data 
</I>&gt;<i> including settings objects for different translators or even specific 
</I>&gt;<i> subrules.
</I>The thought of getListStates is that a controlling app can find out what 
states exist and so allow the user to select the one they wish to use. 
Integers are meaningless in this case as why should the user know what 
those integers mean. I feel uncomfortable with totally unrestricted 
states, states need to follow some sort of standard (even if it is a 
State object API). The other reason for getting the known states is to 
alert the user they have requested an invalid state, why should YABT try 
and process something which simply cannot be translated (IE. no state 
exists for it)? States are causing me a certain difficulty, rules are 
what actually use state, but how can a translator find all states from 
rules? Currently states are registered in the translator by the loader, 
this means that the rules may not actually know anything about states 
but the loader can tell the translator to accept any of the states it 
lists. I suppose this separates states into two categories, those for 
rules, and those permitted as starting states.
&gt;<i> - bf and afcontext: This seems to be too specific as well. So why not 
</I>&gt;<i> work with a context object which may then well be a pair of two 
</I>&gt;<i> strings each representing bf- and afcontext? Or it may be a triple of 
</I>&gt;<i> humidity, temperature and air pressure in Beijing if our translator 
</I>&gt;<i> works on air-conditioning systems rather than strings. That's the 
</I>&gt;<i> beauty of dynamic typing! Just learn to love this freedom, even if it 
</I>&gt;<i> may first seem frightening to a Java programmer!
</I>I question this on the meaning of context. I am using context to mean 
what comes before the focus in the sequence to translate and what comes 
after the focus in the sequence to translate. At some point restrictions 
do need to be laid down, and I personally feel YABT at the most flexible 
is to translate sequences into other sequences (strings being a sequence 
of characters). I would argue that the example you gave is not context 
but rather what is being translated or state. Let me explain further:
* If humidity, temperature and air pressure was only needed for the 
current then it might be a state. This could be complicated as these are 
continual variables, I would opt for next suggestion.
* Humidity, temperature and air pressure may be part of the sequence 
being translated (eg. we may be translating a sequence of atmospheres, 
Atmosphere objects with temperature, humidity and pressure propertie, it 
may have others as wells). Ideally the sequences used should be 
sliceable (supporting the s[x:y] notation). Now focus and both contexts 
can use all three properties. If say the translator in this case (I 
don't quite know what use it really might have) was tracking current 
values, obviously after context cannot be known, so all rules used for 
that should simply use the always match context for after context. I 
feel this is very flexible and powerful once understood.
&gt;<i> - translator.py, line 141: what is input class? What does this if... 
</I>&gt;<i> statement do here?
</I>Discussed in other email, no longer exists.
&gt;<i>  - line 151: logging should go into the base class controlled by some 
</I>&gt;<i> settings. I think we do need a configuration system. You should look 
</I>&gt;<i> at docutils... and become addicted to aspect-oriented programming.
</I>Again dealt earlier, look at logging configuration.
&gt;<i> - - line 164: don't understand why you need the rule set class 
</I>&gt;<i> alongside with rule class.
</I>RuleSet is unused, but is basically to provide a simple RuleSet 
implementation that other RuleSet like classes might build on. Can 
remove if really unneeded and unwanted.
&gt;<i> - line 192: I have the feeling that you need the AddChar stuff because 
</I>&gt;<i> your rule concept is too narrow to use it for efficient char 
</I>&gt;<i> substitution. In this respect, my engine idea could be more 
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward as it encapsulates everything, even translators with 
</I>&gt;<i> hard-coded one-line algorithms rather than loadable rule tables. I 
</I>&gt;<i> guess the constructor of an engine would take only a settings 
</I>&gt;<i> argument. It has an apply method taking the input object and a context 
</I>&gt;<i> object. I would have to think more thoroughly about focus, befor and 
</I>&gt;<i> after context. My only point here is that engines would be suitable 
</I>&gt;<i> both for simple char substitution, control of air-condition systems of 
</I>&gt;<i> Beijing-based hotels and xml-based rule trees. But I must admit that 
</I>&gt;<i> your code arguably does a good job.
</I>I don't know if it exactly fits with what you mean, but I actually now 
start to wonder whether my translator is what you mean by translation 
engine. The only difference is that I feel a translator should be fully 
self contained, IE. there should be no need for sending input through 
more than one, and if there is it might be a special case and might be 
best left to that particular application developer to do that in their 
own code. This self contained thinking is why translators in my design 
do character mappings (or may be if generalised preparation). These two 
stages (preparation and translation should be enough for most cases.
&gt;<i> I must stop here. I'm not sure if I've convinced you to conceptualize 
</I>&gt;<i> the interaction between base_class and the rules a bit differntly. And 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not even sure if it's worth trying, even I would have written this 
</I>&gt;<i> thing in a different way, because my thinking is influenced by docutils.
</I>Yes background is different and I suppose whilst I am writing it in 
python I am still keeping in mind, could I make a java implementation. 
Also might it be best to split API into multiple levels/layers? IE. high 
level which may be done through manager/config module and a low level 
API which may be very much what YABT is now. The high level API may be 
language specific to try and make the most of the language, but low 
level API may be very language independent (partly so I don't get 
confused between the two and if people use the low level API then they 
know YABT for any language implementation.
&gt;<i> Maybe I'll go on trying to convince you later this week.
</I>&gt;<i>
