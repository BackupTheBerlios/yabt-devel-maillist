<PRE>This time I've changed the reply address manually, so it goes to the list.

I guess your very general rule concept any my engine concept refer indeed to
very similar tasks. I'd love to have an afternoon or so to look more deeply
into the sources. But now that I have a couple of minutes to write this
down, please forgive my superficiality.

I don't insist on the name 'engine', even if I find your rule concept
stretches a bit the natural meaning of 'rule'. But let's work on this basis.

1. On the loader concept

I see your point to the extent that you want a given translator to be abel
to use different loaders and vice versa. My only response to the first point
would be a dispatcher mechanism either through an (optional) argument to
__init__ , or according to the file name extension (eg. xml, csv etc.). The
second type of reuse (one loader for different translators) would seem to me
an academic exercise but I may be wrong. But even if there are practical
needs to reuse a given loader for various translators, I would assume that
(multiple) inheritance is the most obvious way to reuse an existing loader.
I cannot currently think of a practical need to allow the user to write a
new loader complying with a particular translator's loader API. But I have
no strong views on this. My only concern is that the loader concept seems
somewhat awkward as it requires two steps to load a rule table: create a
loader object and then pass it to the translator of your choice. These two
steps may be required as you suspect for the future. But today most users
would probably wonder what this is all good for. Can you think of a more
convenient way, say, through a wrapper, default values for arguments etc.? -
I guess the __init__ methods of subclasses would be a good place. I want to
instantiate most translators just by giviny passing a filename of my
favorite rule table, or even less than that (look at PyHyphen where I can
write: h_uk = hyphenator('en_UK'), and the filename is constracted through a
simple join. Clearly, this would require a filename convention which I don't
think is appropriate here because we won't have a subclass for braille
translation, but for, say, translation trees featuring a certain range of
rule types.

On rules

It seems now we are closer than I'd thought yesterday.
This being said:
- I feel uncomfortable with that AddCharMapping staff in the base_class as
char substitution is too specific. Further, as I wrote, char substitution
should be an ordinary rule to be registered with the base class. So may I
suggest you use a simple substitution rule fed either by a plain text file
(as I suggested yesterday), or by a hard-coded dictionary or list of pairs.
- What do you mean by GetListOfStates? I believe you cannot always list all
possible states as these may be unknown or indefinite. I know: a finite
state michine works on a finite number of states... But I'm not comfortable
with this restriction as I feel a state should be defined not by an integer,
but by an object containing multiple settings. Also, the name 'state'
suggests that it may only refer to some property of the translator itself.
However, I think we agree that state can describe any property of anything
in the universe. So I would suggest to replace it by 'settings'.But the
structure of settings objects would have to be defined. I guess a settings
object would be a simple empty container that could store all kinds of data
including settings objects for different translators or even specific
subrules.
- bf and afcontext: This seems to be too specific as well. So why not work
with a context object which may then well be a pair of two strings each
representing bf- and afcontext? Or it may be a triple of humidity,
temperature and air pressure in Beijing if our translator works on
air-conditioning systems rather than strings. That's the beauty of dynamic
typing! Just learn to love this freedom, even if it may first seem
frightening to a Java programmer!
- translator.py, line 141: what is input class? What does this if...
statement do here?
 - line 151: logging should go into the base class controlled by some
settings. I think we do need a configuration system. You should look at
docutils... and become addicted to aspect-oriented programming.
- - line 164: don't understand why you need the rule set class alongside
with rule class.
- line 192: I have the feeling that you need the AddChar stuff because your
rule concept is too narrow to use it for efficient char substitution. In
this respect, my engine idea could be more straightforward as it
encapsulates everything, even translators with hard-coded one-line
algorithms rather than loadable rule tables. I guess the constructor of an
engine would take only a settings argument. It has an apply method taking
the input object and a context object. I would have to think more thoroughly
about focus, befor and after context. My only point here is that engines
would be suitable both for simple char substitution, control of
air-condition systems of Beijing-based hotels and xml-based rule trees. But
I must admit that your code arguably does a good job.

I must stop here. I'm not sure if I've convinced you to conceptualize the
interaction between base_class and the rules a bit differntly. And I'm not
even sure if it's worth trying, even I would have written this thing in a
different way, because my thinking is influenced by docutils.

Maybe I'll go on trying to convince you later this week.

  Betreff: Re: AW: [Yabt-devel] draft specification


  Hello,
  From what I can tell the main questions relate to the loader concept and
the translator/rule relationship.

  Lets start with rules. As things stand at the moment rules contain details
on what they should match (all checked through the isMatch method) and
provide details of what should be substituted for the focus and the state
the translator should be left in. So long as it provides the isMatch method
and the object returned by isMatch has a translation and finalState property
(or returned object can be None if the rule has no knowledge of what to do)
then the translator class is happy. The translator has no knowledge how the
match is determined (the rule can do anything it likes to find the match,
even check what hardware is in the computer if it felt that could be useful
in determining a match). So I suppose rules are like the translation engine.
Rules being like translation engines is even more so when you consider rules
with sub-rules (IE. the translator may only have one actual rule it knows of
because all the rules are sub-rules of the rule the translator has).
Sub-rules would not necessarily need to follow the rule API, but I would
recommend it as types like the GroupStateRuleSet could make use of them.

  The translator has a collection of rules (in YABT it currently is a list
of rules). The translator tries the rules in order until a match is
returned. This list structure need not be followed by rules containing
sub-rules, GroupStateRuleSet uses a dictionary of rules with the key as a
tuple of the group and state. The list structure in the translator gives the
translator the ability to be a hybrid translator (eg. first rule may be a
rule checking for a simple word match (context only can be that which could
surround a word and state could be any), and the second in the list could
then be the current context rule checker). As both of these follow the rule
specification then what rules are used does not matter (eg. the same
translator type could equally be configured to contain a rule to check
whether the focus is at an embedded command, if not then the next rule could
check if the focus is at a user defined exception substitution (like the
word checker but may be substitutions are limited to user defined states),
and if still not satisfied it could then check in the next rule which could
be your binary search idea, and as a very last resort it could use the
current context checker, and it need not stop there but for the purpose of
an example I feel it should).

  This leads on to the loader concept. A loader maps the contents of a data
source into rules which it inserts into a translator. A loader may be used
for more than one translator and one translator can recieve rules from more
than one loader (eg. I may have a loader for a word substitution system
where word substitution is in a plain text file containing two columns of
words and I have my current XML context system loader, so I could load from
the word substitution loader first and then from the XML loader into one
translator. I could then re-use that word substitution loader in a
translator where the second loader may deal with your binary search system).

  Why not include the loader stuff in the rules classes? Simple answer is,
is there only one way to store particular rules? eg. for the word
substitution should a plain text file of two columns be the only storage
system, a sqlite database might be just as good and might intergrate with an
applications data storage better. Also should rules be tied to how they are
used? eg. GroupStateRuleSet is a container rule, a loader could make it
contain any rule like object not just the GeneralContextRule.

  I feel there may be some parts which we might be meaning similar things
but using different terms for, or may be I am heading for objects rather
than methods/functions because of Java. EG. you refer to translators dealing
with translation engines, I refer to rules, how different really are the
tasks these are doing? There may be some difference (IE. my translator
classes would deal with stepping through the input, I get the feeling that
would be for the translation engine in your design).

  I am wondering whether I should make simple examples of loaders and rules
to demonstrate some of what I was meaning above, as it might be unclear
without an actual working example. Might this be helpful?

    That's the kind of discussion we need. Attached is the revised version
containing my responses to your comments and some changes partly reflecting
your comments, partly making my thinking hopefully clearer.

    I see two main areas of diverging views which are due to our different
past (you as the author of yabt, me as a somewhat chaotic hobby programmer
attracted by some concepts of docutils)::

    1. The role of base_translator:
    - both: provide an API, subclassable to implement specific algorithms.
    - you: base_class should provide some support for rule handling
    - me: base_class should merely provide the API and some useful framework
operations such as logging, dispatching, hosting (registration) of multiple
algorithms...

    2. Codes and subcodes (eg. English, math and music)
    - you: a translation engine can be aware of these and handle them
appropriately.
    - me: the app should identify subcodes, eg., by parsing a marked-up
input text, and call the appropriate translator.

    ad 1.: This is a fundamental design choice. We should give more thought
on that. Let me make a point in favor of my proposal: I believe it could be
useful if base_translator could host third-party applications such as the
unix commands pr, mroff, rst2latex etc., and camouflate them as ordinary
yabt translator objects. I also think of third-party Braille translation
tools such as to convert musicXML into braille notes. This is all very
preliminary, of course.

    ad 2.: It would depend on how much complexity an implementor may want to
handle. In any event, there seems to be merit in having the app parse input
texts and split it into different sections. Another example might be
multilingual texts: the input text contains some mark-up, say, by extending
reStructuredText. The app parses it and calls the translator for German or
English where appropriate. This is more general than hard-coded $-commands
(which might though be useful in certain contexts as well). A final example:
html docs containing tables, lists, images etc, even if I have no idea on
how to translate an image except for printing the alt-tag if present at all.
    I guess this point is less fundamental and both approaches do not
exclude one another. Well, they shouldn't exclude one another. hence, the
$-commands should be configurable / be optional, through config files in
order not to inferfere with other mark-up.

      Hello,
      Time to get to the really interesting stuff, in some ways I am not
over bothered about the scripts interface, it primarily was a demonstration
app, the internals must be right as that can affect both the script and
useage through the API.

      I had a read of what you had written, my view is mixed. I think we
have come at it from quite different angles. I tried to put in my comments
(in two stages &lt;MW&gt; indicates initial thoughts and &lt;MW2&gt; indicates thoughts
after leaving it and trying to leave some of my java views behind).

      I have also decided, as the approaches were so different, it might be
worth me expressing what I am thinking (the difference is so great I
couldn't edit in my own thoughts for the design). I have written it in the
body of this email.

      Ideally before saying technically what methods/properties classes
should have, let's consider what it should actually do/provide.

      1. Translator

      A translator should:
      * translate some input into an output format.
      * translation should be performed according to a collection of rules.
      * a translator should be able to be configured to use particular rules
(eg. rules for text to British Braille)
      * to minimise the rules required simple substitutions may be performed
before the main translation process.
      * translation should permit smooth switching between different
sub-codes of the main code (IE. British literary Braille and British maths
Braille are sub-codes of British Braille. This could be taken further,
Braille is a code, British Braille and German Braille are sub-codes). The
definition of smooth switching is where specific things should be done at
joins, then they should actually be done without the app using YABT to know
of this code specific join detail (eg. in British Braille typically an in
line equation should be followed by a dot 6 if the next character is
punctuation, the controlling app should not know that British Braille would
require this dot 6 in this case).
      * the context of the translation should be specified (IE. does this
translation belong next to the end of a page or does it have a maths
equation after it, etc).

      2. Rules

      A rule should:
      * Match if the current position meets certain criteria specified in
the rule
      * May contain other rules which it can check (IE. it can be a filter
rule to lower the checks to be done). In this case it should report the
match as the sub-rule which matches.
      * As a rule knows how it should match, it should perform all checks to
confirm if it is a match (IE. it should decide from all position information
whether it matches and disregard/ignore any information not required by
itself).

      3. Loader

      It is imagined that it would be useful to have tables stored on a
storage device (eg. hard disk, USB memory stick, etc), so something needs to
read this data and manipulate the translator to contain the correct rules
(it would be too much to expect application developers to do all this
themselves and by having common code for this could standardise the table
formats whilst allowing developers flexibility to use their own if they so
desire).

      A loader should:
      * load rules into a translator according to data in a data source.
      * data source should be able to be specified by the controlling app
      * loaders should be reuseable (IE. both specifying a different data
source once used and also to load data into more than one translator).

      4. Configuration module

      I am uncertain whether this is needed or not, but here is my views of
what it could provide if it were to be included.

      * allow loaders and translators to register with it and provide user
friendly names
      * allow an application to enquire registered loaders and translators
and obtain user friendly details
      * allow selection of loader and translator (eg. as a factory,
particular type could be specified by name returning a relevant instance)


      I know none of that is implementation specific, but I feel it may be
best to take this extra step back. If all of the above were to be done, then
all YABT currently lacks is the configuration module and possibly it could
do with better manipulation of rules in a translator (I could do with
expanding on what I mean by configuration of rules). If I have to go to
classes (I want to get specification at this level cleared up first) I would
say:
      * Different loaders deal with different input source types
      * different translators deal with different translation types (eg.
text to Braille, XML to speech, etc).

      Comments welcome.

        What do you think in terms of future design (core, base_translator,
standard implementations etc.)? I'll read through the modules and hope to
understand the bulk. But this may take some time. That said, I would assume
it could be smarter to write down some fairly general specification of the
base_class (to do it top-down), without too much looking at YABT. I say this
because I personally feel I'd like more clarity on the design. You come from
somewhere else, of course, as you know yabt by heart. This gives you a great
advantage in terms of clarity on technical issues. But in an ideal world we
would probably sit down on a hill, relax, draft what we believe would be an
ideal architecture and find out afterwards what's already there. Then we
would either take yabt as it is, because we believe it is ideal, take it and
make some changes, or rewrite it from scratch, because we have found it not
ideal at all. The second alternative seems most likely. You may find this
approach annoying as you seem to know what an ideal translator would do. In
my World though, there is little knowledge on YABT and much room for
creativity. At the risk of wasting everybody's time (in case yabt is ideal),
but in the hope that yabt's architecture leaves some room for enhancement, I
attach a first and incomplete draft specification to be continued or
dropped.



        Happy to discuss.
