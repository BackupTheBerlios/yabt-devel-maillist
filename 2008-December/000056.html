The only difference is that I feel a translator should be fully self

self contained thinking is why translators in my design do character
mappings (or may be if generalised preparation). These two stages
(preparation and translation should be enough for most cases.


Agreed. But the appearance of one self-contained translator could be
achieved at translator level or at translator manager level. I guess you
mean the former; I for one am still open to both. In any event, the design
has to allow the following cases:

- char substitution throughout the text, no matter how long, how many
paragraphs, formfeed etc.

- word substitution using, say, a two column table loaded from a csv file.
This should be tried for individual words. And if substitution succeeds, the
xml rules are not applied to that word because the explicit translation
table is presumed to be more accurate or just faster than the rules.

In my idea of an engine I tried to reflect the distinction through a
split_into_chunks method. This implies that some rules may apply to the
whole text whereas others apply only to individual words such that the text
(sequence) needs to have been split up before. But all this would have to be
refined.

You wrote:
I question this on the meaning of context. I am using context to mean what
comes before the focus in the sequence to translate and what comes after the
focus in the sequence to translate. At some point restrictions do need to be
laid down, and I personally feel YABT at the most flexible is to translate
sequences into other sequences (strings being a sequence of characters). I
would argue that the example you gave is not context but rather what is
being translated or state. Let me explain further:
* If humidity, temperature and air pressure was only needed for the current
then it might be a state. This could be complicated as these are continual
variables, I would opt for next suggestion.
* Humidity, temperature and air pressure may be part of the sequence being
translated (eg. we may be translating a sequence of atmospheres, Atmosphere
objects with temperature, humidity and pressure propertie, it may have
others as wells). Ideally the sequences used should be sliceable (supporting
the s[x:y] notation). Now focus and both contexts can use all three
properties. If say the translator in this case (I don't quite know what use
it really might have) was tracking current values, obviously after context
cannot be known, so all rules used for that should simply use the always
match context for after context. I feel this is very flexible and powerful
once understood.


  My example refers to an object describing an air-conditioning system with
properties such as propeller speed, heating or cooling activity, permissible
temperature interval or whatever. The purpose of a translator could be to
transform the current properties into new ones taking into account the
actual air properties (i.e. humidity, temperature, pressure etc.) according
to certain rules. Context could be a sequence of atmosphere objects
representing the change of air properties over time. Rules could implement a
function defined on two variables (context and air-conditioning system)
whereby each consists of several attributes. The translator (= function)
returns an air condition system object. So I would describe a translator to
be a function defined on (input type, context type), returning an object of
the same type as input. Context and input can be arbitrary objects. OK, now
I see that splitting is too specific for that, as air conditioning system
objects cannot be split into chunks whereas sequences can. Well, splitting
an air-conditioning system (ACS) could mean: extracting its temperature
corridor (= a pair of two real numbers), and pass it on to a more specific
subrule. But this would be at implementation level. Base_translator would
not be concerned with specific input or context types. Of course, context
and input can be objects of the same class (as you imply to be a reasonable
restriction). I, in turn, tend to believe this is just a special case. In
general, context and input can be of very different types. This reflects
most real life situations. Only when translating such uniform things such as
text, you have the privilege to consider left and right characters / words
etc. which happen to be of the same type of what's to be translated.
  As regards your understanding of context, I have the impression that your
design mixes up the static context data (i.e. what's written right or left
of the focus), and the translator function (i.e. how the output is
calculated). A context that always matches means a function that does not
depend on the context, i.e. it is invariant with regard to the value of
context. I would assume this to be a property of certain subrules, whereas
you consider it to be a property of certain context objhects. I find it
difficult to follow this approach as I believe a rule should decide how to
change the focus given the focus and the context, where as the context
should be just a description of something outside the focus. A rule that
happens to be context-invariant would consider just the focus and apply some
function on it, leaving the context aside. So in my mind there is no such
thing as a matching or unmatching context. There is only a function which,
given an input type object and a context object, may return a new input type
object or None. In the former case one may say: the rule matches, in the
latter that it does not match.

  So could we be hitting problems because YABT is now &quot;a context sensitive
string manipulation tool&quot; and so the specific task (originally Braille
translation) is not focusing what is really wanted? Whether this is right or
wrong at the moment I am unsure, but working to actual usage examples
probably would help focus things.

  I suggest to work top-down, i.e. from the component class, through the
translation manager (if you agree on that it is useful), via the
base_translator down to implementations of base_translator, rules, file
formats etc. Now I guess I am on the base translator level. And I must admit
I have a bias for as much generality as possible (see above). Willie's
advice would, I think, apply to the implementations: one for
air-condition-systems, another for Braille text etc. But my bias toward
generality merely derives from a market intellectual ambition rather than
from my discontentment with existing air-conditioning systems.

   You wrote:
  Loaders: I am unsure whether this is done for users purposes or mine. It
means that there may be a whole library of rule types and someone could
develop a table which could make use of a combination of those rules never
used together before. Whether anyone is going to do that I don't know, but
it would be nice to be able to say to someone who asks for a particular
translation system, yes it can be made easily by just creating a new loader
and then just making that loader for them.

  I now concur with the idea of different loader classes. That said, I still
don't understand why new rule types would require new loaders... Loading an
xml table with ElementTree is a one-liner for any rule tree. Clearly, the
translator must provide a handler function for each rule type. But I fully
see the necessity to have different loaders for sqlite, plain text, xml from
file, xml from the internet etc. As regards my assertion on ElementTree, I
may be underestimating what your xml loaders do. I assume they are that
complicated because you are using xpat rather than ElementTree or even lxml.
Further, I do not understand what loaders do with regard to states (see
below).

  You wrote:
  The thought of getListStates is that a controlling app can find out what
states exist and so allow the user to select the one they wish to use.
Integers are meaningless in this case as why should the user know what those
integers mean. I feel uncomfortable with totally unrestricted states, states
need to follow some sort of standard (even if it is a State object API). The
other reason for getting the known states is to alert the user they have
requested an invalid state, why should YABT try and process something which
simply cannot be translated (IE. no state exists for it)? States are causing
me a certain difficulty, rules are what actually use state, but how can a
translator find all states from rules? Currently states are registered in
the translator by the loader, this means that the rules may not actually
know anything about states but the loader can tell the translator to accept
any of the states it lists. I suppose this separates states into two
categories, those for rules, and those permitted as starting states.


  For some reason I do not have any difficulty with states as I do not see
why a translator - whatever that is - should know all states. Being told
them by the loader is, from my perspective, unnecessary. A state - being
implemented as a dictionary or, if you feel a need for hierarchical
structures, a suitable recursive, simple class structure - is to my mind a
means to store variables accessed by rules. Each xml file should contain a
node called init_state or so, being a child of root. It should be processed
at load time. The corresponding handler function should att the dictionary
to the translator so any rule handler can access it. After initializing the
state from the attributes of the init_state node, the init_state handler
should override it with a corresponding config section from the translator's
config file, finally with optional arguments passed to the constructor. Then
the translator is in a well-defined state. Certain rule types will change
some values within state. A state member could be used, eg., to marshall
statistics on the input stream, store info on whether or not to use
capitalization in the Braille output, define formats for date, time, grade 1
or 2. It would have to be discussed if, alongside with state, there should
be some sort of settings influencing the behavior of rules but which the
rules cannot modify. Much of this is, I understand, already implemented in
yabt, except for the config file. That said, I really do not see why the
loader should build up the state, rather than a node handler for init_state
called by some method that initializes the translator, maybe indeed the
loader, but not through proprietary code within the loader. The
init_state_handler would be reusable for all xml tables no matter what rule
types they use. I wouldn't even see a problem in allowing rules to add new
variables to state, if needed. But in most cases this won't be necessary.
With suitable rule types you could specify a full-featured programming
language.

  To distinguish state from context, I would say that each state can be
changed by certain rule types whereas context must be taken as it is.
Further, the apply method which executes the translator on a particular
input, must be given a new context, whereas the state is not necessarily
modified upon each call of the translator.


  On configuration

  Maybe the component class from docutils is a good starting point. But
ideally there would be a general config framework available both in Python
and Java. I don't know if such exists. You could look at pyspring if you
wish, or cfgparser that claims to be more convenient and powerful than
configparser from the standard library.

  I'll be travelling for the coming two weeks; internet access will be
sparse, if at all. So just in case: merry Xmas and best wishes for the new
year.

    I guess your very general rule concept any my engine concept refer
indeed to very similar tasks. I'd love to have an afternoon or so to look
more deeply into the sources. But now that I have a couple of minutes to
write this down, please forgive my superficiality.

    I don't insist on the name 'engine', even if I find your rule concept
stretches a bit the natural meaning of 'rule'. But let's work on this basis.
  May be rule is poorly named, but I felt it fitted as it determines whether
a translation can occur and how it should occur. Different instances of
these objects may determine if a translation can occur in different ways
(even yielding different answers) and may say that the translation should be
applied in a different way. To me a single component, of which there may be
many, which decides on if and how to do something is a rule. Reflecting on
this may be my rule is at a slightly different level in the process. I think
this difference in assigning what is where is better shown else where, read
on.


    1. On the loader concept

    I see your point to the extent that you want a given translator to be
abel to use different loaders and vice versa. My only response to the first
point would be a dispatcher mechanism either through an (optional) argument
to __init__ , or according to the file name extension (eg. xml, csv etc.).
The second type of reuse (one loader for different translators) would seem
to me an academic exercise but I may be wrong. But even if there are
practical needs to reuse a given loader for various translators, I would
assume that (multiple) inheritance is the most obvious way to reuse an
existing loader. I cannot currently think of a practical need to allow the
user to write a new loader complying with a particular translator's loader
API. But I have no strong views on this. My only concern is that the loader
concept seems somewhat awkward as it requires two steps to load a rule
table: create a loader object and then pass it to the translator of your
choice. These two steps may be required as you suspect for the future. But
today most users would probably wonder what this is all good for. Can you
think of a more convenient way, say, through a wrapper, default values for
arguments etc.? - I guess the __init__ methods of subclasses would be a good
place. I want to instantiate most translators just by giviny passing a
filename of my favorite rule table, or even less than that (look at PyHyphen
where I can write: h_uk = hyphenator('en_UK'), and the filename is
constracted through a simple join. Clearly, this would require a filename
convention which I don't think is appropriate here because we won't have a
subclass for braille translation, but for, say, translation trees featuring
a certain range of rule types.
  This raises a few questions:
  * The problem that we have no specific translator for Braille, I remember
Willie Walker in an Orca presentation saying that one piece of advice he was
given that he feels was good is to not generalise unless you have enough
cases to require you to generalise. So could we be hitting problems because
YABT is now &quot;a context sensitive string manipulation tool&quot; and so the
specific task (originally Braille translation) is not focusing what is
really wanted? Whether this is right or wrong at the moment I am unsure, but
working to actual usage examples probably would help focus things.
  * Loaders: I am unsure whether this is done for users purposes or mine. It
means that there may be a whole library of rule types and someone could
develop a table which could make use of a combination of those rules never
used together before. Whether anyone is going to do that I don't know, but
it would be nice to be able to say to someone who asks for a particular
translation system, yes it can be made easily by just creating a new loader
and then just making that loader for them. The other reason I want the
loader system is my own purpose. If at some point I wish to change the table
format (as I feel the existing XML format needs to be) then I can leave the
existing loader in place develop the new loader, test it out my self, then
add a way users can opt to use it and then in one simple change of code make
the new loader the default (and all I need to do is sit back and wait for
all the emails describing all the problems caused by the sudden change).
  * Creating a translator in one quick simple single liner, yes YABT doesn't
do it currently, but does YABT need to change its design or does YABT just
need another layer, eg. what I have referred to as a config module, but may
be it would be better called a translator manager module, or may be just
something else. I haven't really given this layer much thought, it may do
more of what you call the dispatcher,  or may be it would just be a factory
module (eg. createTranslator(translatorType, tableSource, tableType) (or
something like that) which would return a translator class pre-loaded with
rules from a loader registered for processing tableType).


    On rules

    It seems now we are closer than I'd thought yesterday.
    This being said:
    - I feel uncomfortable with that AddCharMapping staff in the base_class
as char substitution is too specific. Further, as I wrote, char substitution
should be an ordinary rule to be registered with the base class. So may I
suggest you use a simple substitution rule fed either by a plain text file
(as I suggested yesterday), or by a hard-coded dictionary or list of pairs.
  May be AddCharMapping could be changed, it might be addPrepRule(Rule)
which means that any rule can be added for the preparation stage but these
should be simple although YABT won't restrict this.

    - What do you mean by GetListOfStates? I believe you cannot always list
all possible states as these may be unknown or indefinite. I know: a finite
state michine works on a finite number of states... But I'm not comfortable
with this restriction as I feel a state should be defined not by an integer,
but by an object containing multiple settings. Also, the name 'state'
suggests that it may only refer to some property of the translator itself.
However, I think we agree that state can describe any property of anything
in the universe. So I would suggest to replace it by 'settings'.But the
structure of settings objects would have to be defined. I guess a settings
object would be a simple empty container that could store all kinds of data
including settings objects for different translators or even specific
subrules.
  The thought of getListStates is that a controlling app can find out what
states exist and so allow the user to select the one they wish to use.
Integers are meaningless in this case as why should the user know what those
integers mean. I feel uncomfortable with totally unrestricted states, states
need to follow some sort of standard (even if it is a State object API). The
other reason for getting the known states is to alert the user they have
requested an invalid state, why should YABT try and process something which
simply cannot be translated (IE. no state exists for it)? States are causing
me a certain difficulty, rules are what actually use state, but how can a
translator find all states from rules? Currently states are registered in
the translator by the loader, this means that the rules may not actually
know anything about states but the loader can tell the translator to accept
any of the states it lists. I suppose this separates states into two
categories, those for rules, and those permitted as starting states.

    - bf and afcontext: This seems to be too specific as well. So why not
work with a context object which may then well be a pair of two strings each
representing bf- and afcontext? Or it may be a triple of humidity,
temperature and air pressure in Beijing if our translator works on
air-conditioning systems rather than strings. That's the beauty of dynamic
typing! Just learn to love this freedom, even if it may first seem
frightening to a Java programmer!
  I question this on the meaning of context. I am using context to mean what
comes before the focus in the sequence to translate and what comes after the
focus in the sequence to translate. At some point restrictions do need to be
laid down, and I personally feel YABT at the most flexible is to translate
sequences into other sequences (strings being a sequence of characters). I
would argue that the example you gave is not context but rather what is
being translated or state. Let me explain further:
  * If humidity, temperature and air pressure was only needed for the
current then it might be a state. This could be complicated as these are
continual variables, I would opt for next suggestion.
  * Humidity, temperature and air pressure may be part of the sequence being
translated (eg. we may be translating a sequence of atmospheres, Atmosphere
objects with temperature, humidity and pressure propertie, it may have
others as wells). Ideally the sequences used should be sliceable (supporting
the s[x:y] notation). Now focus and both contexts can use all three
properties. If say the translator in this case (I don't quite know what use
it really might have) was tracking current values, obviously after context
cannot be known, so all rules used for that should simply use the always
match context for after context. I feel this is very flexible and powerful
once understood.

    - translator.py, line 141: what is input class? What does this if...
statement do here?
  Discussed in other email, no longer exists.

     - line 151: logging should go into the base class controlled by some
settings. I think we do need a configuration system. You should look at
docutils... and become addicted to aspect-oriented programming.
  Again dealt earlier, look at logging configuration.

    - - line 164: don't understand why you need the rule set class alongside
with rule class.
  RuleSet is unused, but is basically to provide a simple RuleSet
implementation that other RuleSet like classes might build on. Can remove if
really unneeded and unwanted.

    - line 192: I have the feeling that you need the AddChar stuff because
your rule concept is too narrow to use it for efficient char substitution.
In this respect, my engine idea could be more straightforward as it
encapsulates everything, even translators with hard-coded one-line
algorithms rather than loadable rule tables. I guess the constructor of an
engine would take only a settings argument. It has an apply method taking
the input object and a context object. I would have to think more thoroughly
about focus, befor and after context. My only point here is that engines
would be suitable both for simple char substitution, control of
air-condition systems of Beijing-based hotels and xml-based rule trees. But
I must admit that your code arguably does a good job.
  I don't know if it exactly fits with what you mean, but I actually now
start to wonder whether my translator is what you mean by translation
engine. The only difference is that I feel a translator should be fully self
contained, IE. there should be no need for sending input through more than
one, and if there is it might be a special case and might be best left to
that particular application developer to do that in their own code. This
self contained thinking is why translators in my design do character
mappings (or may be if generalised preparation). These two stages
(preparation and translation should be enough for most cases.


    I must stop here. I'm not sure if I've convinced you to conceptualize
the interaction between base_class and the rules a bit differntly. And I'm
not even sure if it's worth trying, even I would have written this thing in
a different way, because my thinking is influenced by docutils.
  Yes background is different and I suppose whilst I am writing it in python
I am still keeping in mind, could I make a java implementation. Also might
it be best to split API into multiple levels/layers? IE. high level which
may be done through manager/config module and a low level API which may be
very much what YABT is now. The high level API may be language specific to
try and make the most of the language, but low level API may be very
language independent (partly so I don't get confused between the two and if
people use the low level API then they know YABT for any language
implementation.
