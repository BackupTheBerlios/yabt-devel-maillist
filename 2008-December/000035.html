<PRE>Hello,
I have made some comments in amongst yours.

</I>)
I am using the optparse module in python and as I remember I used the 
string substitution stuff provided by that for the name. May be its not 
working as I would have hoped/expected. I will see to this.
&gt;<i> - allow the specification of an output file; redirection is not the 
</I>&gt;<i> most obvious way.
</I>I can add this easily. For a unix user redirection is well known and 
very flexible but as I am targeting as many platforms as possible then I 
could imagine its not so well known on Windows.

&gt;<i> - add info on default values to the help text
</I>I will take a look at this, I can't remember what I meant to do on this. 
Hopefully optparse will help.
&gt;<i> --version prints 2.0. Is this intended?
</I>Yes, but maybe confusing, should I include a version variable inside the 
package? May be I could get the information from setuptools (this is 
where I feel I should naturally get it from as packages using this can 
specify the version to use) but I don't remember seeing that in the 
setuptools docs.
&gt;<i> On README
</I>&gt;<i> You could copy some lines from the long_description in setup.py to 
</I>&gt;<i> avoid a too Braille-centric appearance
</I>Ideally I would have some sort of common source so that the two are kept 
in sync but I can imagine that getting complex and distracting so may be 
just copy and paste will work better.

&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i> But these are very minor comments that should not prevent you from 
</I>&gt;<i> pushing 2.0b2 out immediately.
</I>Unfortunately as far as the comments go, too late I pushed it out 
yesterday. If any of these are felt to be critical then I can make 
YABT-2.0b2.1 or YABT-2.0b2Update1 to indicate it essentially is 
YABT-2.0b2 with corrections (this is why I wanted pre version 
development numbering rather than post release numbering on mercurial 
commits).
