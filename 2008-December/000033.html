<PRE>Hello,
I have made the release of YABT 2.0b2 earlier today. For the full 
announcement I will leave it to you if you wish to read it in the news 
section of the YABT project page.

I feel more importantly now that this release has be made a full review 
of what the next version of YABT should do/offer and review what might 
be the best way to move it towards that. I personally feel that YABT in 
its current form does offer most of what is needed but could do with 
some work on the API to provide this better/more easily. Also according 
to my versioning scheme as the 2.0 branch is not final yet it is 
permisible to have significant changes to the API (ideally it should 
have been in alpha stage but when I made the first YABT 2.0 branch 
release I thought things were more final than they were). Due to this I 
propose putting further development forward as working towards YABT-2.0b3.

Michael Whapples
