<PRE>Great! Congratulations! I've seen the announcement which reads quite nice...
You may wish to update the cover page as well at some point. Further, I
wonder if you want to upload a html version of the RST file containing the
announcement.

I wished I could spend more time on these issues. I guess I'll have to
understand the nitty-gritty of yabt to make more meaningful suggestions on
the design of 2.0b3...
By the way: recently I bumped into another xml tool that is based on
ElementTree: lxml - a wrapper around libxml2 which is Gnome's xml enging.
See www.xmlsoft.org. It's also on the pypi. At some point we will have to
decide if we want to write an xslt or dtd for yabt xml files... lxml could
come in handy. But this is for the future.

Like you, I would expect the design to be worked out best top-down, so
xml-related subclasses would come at the end.

Betreff: [Yabt-devel] YABT 2.0b2 released


Hello,
I have made the release of YABT 2.0b2 earlier today. For the full
announcement I will leave it to you if you wish to read it in the news
section of the YABT project page.

I feel more importantly now that this release has be made a full review
of what the next version of YABT should do/offer and review what might
be the best way to move it towards that. I personally feel that YABT in
its current form does offer most of what is needed but could do with
some work on the API to provide this better/more easily. Also according
to my versioning scheme as the 2.0 branch is not final yet it is
permisible to have significant changes to the API (ideally it should
have been in alpha stage but when I made the first YABT 2.0 branch
release I thought things were more final than they were). Due to this I
propose putting further development forward as working towards YABT-2.0b3.

Michael Whapples
