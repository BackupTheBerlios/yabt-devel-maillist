<PRE>Hello,
I think I have now found some articles wich explain what I am trying to 
do with YABT with my design.

In previous messages I mentioned about spring and its configuration, yes 
it would be wrong for YABT to provide that configuration framework, but 
it should support being used within that framework (IE. support being 
used by those applications). Spring is huge and may over complicate what 
I am meaning, the part I am getting at is the inversion of control and 
dependency injection stuff. I have had a look for some explainations of 
it and found (<A HREF="http://wiki.python.org/moin/DependencyInjectionPattern">http://wiki.python.org/moin/DependencyInjectionPattern</A>). 
That particular page is not so useful on its own but it has some good 
links (Martin Fowler's article is good). I feel translators and rules 
should be loosely coupled, translators and loaders should be loosely 
couple but unfortunately loaders and rules may not be loosely coupled 
(reason being that loader deals with a data source representing rules). 
As dependency injection deals with plain old python objects (POPOs, I am 
using this to reflect the java term POJO) then YABT doesn't need to 
concern itself with anything of the controlling app (whether the 
controlling app actually uses a dependency ijection framework or what 
that framework is, or if the app just creates the objects as in yabt-trans).

The configuration module I mentioned recently where all loaders and 
translators could register would be optional and potentially would 
provide a replacement to the dependency injection system. The 
configuration module would be more suited for dynamic applications where 
users may select the loaders and translators they want (eg. the 
controlling app might call a getTranslatorList method/function and use 
the information returned to display a list of translators and their 
descriptions to the user for the user to select which they want to use 
and then the app would get an instance by calling something like 
createTranslatorByName).

How does my structure sound now I have mentioned all this?
