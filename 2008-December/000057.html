</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Is this preparation? If so YABT allows it but may be it could be 
generalised so that it isn't limited to chars.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - char substitution throughout the text, no matter how long, how many 
</I>&gt;<i> paragraphs, formfeed etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - word substitution using, say, a two column table loaded from a csv 
</I>&gt;<i> file. This should be tried for individual words. And if substitution 
</I>&gt;<i> succeeds, the xml rules are not applied to that word because the 
</I>&gt;<i> explicit translation table is presumed to be more accurate or just 
</I>&gt;<i> faster than the rules.
</I>Multiple loaders, may be I should create a word substitution loader and 
rule system which can be applied. This might also highlight some of what 
I feel the advantages of loaders are.
&gt;<i> In my idea of an engine I tried to reflect the distinction through a 
</I>&gt;<i> split_into_chunks method. This implies that some rules may apply to 
</I>&gt;<i> the whole text whereas others apply only to individual words such that 
</I>&gt;<i> the text (sequence) needs to have been split up before. But all this 
</I>&gt;<i> would have to be refined.
</I>The current XML rule system deals with varying length focus (IE. some 
apply to a focus of 2 letters, some to 5 letters, or some to simply 1 
letter, or infact any number of letters (0 should never be done as if it 
could be applied then we would get stuck), and none of these lengths 
need apply to a specific type of chunk, it may be a word, it may be part 
of a word, etc its all down to what I call the context as to what that 
particular focus dcan be). BufferedTranslator is making arbitrary splits 
where it is unlikely that any rule will ever run across the join, and 
the reason for the splitting is to help with speed, try that really long 
example I mentioned before and observe the difference in processing time 
(NOTE: it may take some time, with psyco it takes approx 8 seconds on my 
2.4GHz machine and without psyco it takes 40+ seconds on the same 
machine when using the BufferedTranslator, expect much longer times when 
using the standard Translator).

</I>&gt;<i> I question this on the meaning of context. I am using context to mean 
</I>&gt;<i> what comes before the focus in the sequence to translate and what 
</I>&gt;<i> comes after the focus in the sequence to translate. At some point 
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions do need to be laid down, and I personally feel YABT at 
</I>&gt;<i> the most flexible is to translate sequences into other sequences 
</I>&gt;<i> (strings being a sequence of characters). I would argue that the 
</I>&gt;<i> example you gave is not context but rather what is being translated or 
</I>&gt;<i> state. Let me explain further:
</I>&gt;<i> * If humidity, temperature and air pressure was only needed for the 
</I>&gt;<i> current then it might be a state. This could be complicated as these 
</I>&gt;<i> are continual variables, I would opt for next suggestion.
</I>&gt;<i> * Humidity, temperature and air pressure may be part of the sequence 
</I>&gt;<i> being translated (eg. we may be translating a sequence of atmospheres, 
</I>&gt;<i> Atmosphere objects with temperature, humidity and pressure propertie, 
</I>&gt;<i> it may have others as wells). Ideally the sequences used should be 
</I>&gt;<i> sliceable (supporting the s[x:y] notation). Now focus and both 
</I>&gt;<i> contexts can use all three properties. If say the translator in this 
</I>&gt;<i> case (I don't quite know what use it really might have) was tracking 
</I>&gt;<i> current values, obviously after context cannot be known, so all rules 
</I>&gt;<i> used for that should simply use the always match context for after 
</I>&gt;<i> context. I feel this is very flexible and powerful once understood.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My example refers to an object describing an air-conditioning system 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with properties such as propeller speed, heating or cooling activity, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> permissible temperature interval or whatever. The purpose of a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> translator could be to transform the current properties into new ones 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> taking into account the actual air properties (i.e. humidity, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> temperature, pressure etc.) according to certain rules. Context could 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a sequence of atmosphere objects representing the change of air 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> properties over time. Rules could implement a function defined on two 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variables (context and air-conditioning system) whereby each consists 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of several attributes. The translator (= function) returns an air 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> condition system object. So I would describe a translator to be a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function defined on (input type, context type), returning an object 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the same type as input. Context and input can be arbitrary 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objects. OK, now I see that splitting is too specific for that, as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> air conditioning system objects cannot be split into chunks whereas 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sequences can. Well, splitting an air-conditioning system (ACS) could 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mean: extracting its temperature corridor (= a pair of two real 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> numbers), and pass it on to a more specific subrule. But this would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be at implementation level. Base_translator would not be concerned 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with specific input or context types. Of course, context and input 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be objects of the same class (as you imply to be a reasonable 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restriction). I, in turn, tend to believe this is just a special 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case. In general, context and input can be of very different types. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This reflects most real life situations. Only when translating such 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uniform things such as text, you have the privilege to consider left 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and right characters / words etc. which happen to be of the same type 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of what's to be translated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As regards your understanding of context, I have the impression that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your design mixes up the static context data (i.e. what's written 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right or left of the focus), and the translator function (i.e. how 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the output is calculated). A context that always matches means a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function that does not depend on the context, i.e. it is invariant 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with regard to the value of context. I would assume this to be a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> property of certain subrules, whereas you consider it to be a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> property of certain context objhects. I find it difficult to follow 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this approach as I believe a rule should decide how to change the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> focus given the focus and the context, where as the context should be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just a description of something outside the focus. A rule that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happens to be context-invariant would consider just the focus and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> apply some function on it, leaving the context aside. So in my mind 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is no such thing as a matching or unmatching context. There is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only a function which, given an input type object and a context 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> object, may return a new input type object or None. In the former 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case one may say: the rule matches, in the latter that it does not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> match.
</I>This bit is slightly deeper than I want at this particular time, I 
really need to work through this. From what I am understanding, the 
following may help:
* I made context objects always present in rule objects initially as 
rules were so specific and it seemed simpler to just have something 
which always says it matches than to have something in the rule class to 
not check in specific cases/instances.
* Following on with this simplicity, I still argue that it is easier to 
say this context is applicable all the time (regardless of what the 
actual context is) than to have all the cases (eg. the before context 
not being used but the after context being used, the after context not 
being used but the before context being used, neither context being used 
or both contexts being used). This for the current design of YABT would 
add so many different rule types.
* it didn't feel to unatural to say that a rule should always match the 
context.

As for use with other systems (the air conditioning one I will continue 
with), I would see it may be passing in a list of atomspheres (or may be 
a list of tuples containing atmospheres and systems properties), with 
each value being a different time point. To focus on one particular 
part, the rule may say something like:
if temperature &gt; desiredTemperature:
   if previousTemperature &lt;= temperature:
     coolFurther() # this would hopefully set a property for cooling to 
be greater
   else:
     # set the cooling to what it is because it is going towards the 
desired temperature anyway

In this case we are still dealing with a sequence, and context still 
falls in the definition of the points/slices of a list adjacent to the 
focus.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So could we be hitting problems because YABT is now &quot;a context 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sensitive string manipulation tool&quot; and so the specific task 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (originally Braille translation) is not focusing what is really 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wanted? Whether this is right or wrong at the moment I am unsure, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working to actual usage examples probably would help focus things.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suggest to work top-down, i.e. from the component class, through 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the translation manager (if you agree on that it is useful), via the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> base_translator down to implementations of base_translator, rules, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file formats etc. Now I guess I am on the base translator level. And 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I must admit I have a bias for as much generality as possible (see 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above). Willie's advice would, I think, apply to the implementations: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one for air-condition-systems, another for Braille text etc. But my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bias toward generality merely derives from a market intellectual 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ambition rather than from my discontentment with existing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> air-conditioning systems.
</I>I think what I am thinking of is without knowing what particular 
implementations want, how can we ensure the interfaces have that 
feature? What I am considering is, do we need to focus on the braille 
and speech examples, where possible use more generalised terms (eg. 
string means sequence of characters, there fore the interface deals with 
sequences of objects).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I now concur with the idea of different loader classes. That said, I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any rule tree. Clearly, the translator must provide a handler 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function for each rule type. But I fully see the necessity to have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different loaders for sqlite, plain text, xml from file, xml from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internet etc. As regards my assertion on ElementTree, I may be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> underestimating what your xml loaders do. I assume they are that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complicated because you are using xpat rather than ElementTree or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even lxml. Further, I do not understand what loaders do with regard 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to states (see below).
</I>Currently there is not anyway to specify rule class types in XML, but it 
might be possible in future (eg. I could have a ruledef element where 
people could specify the classes they want and then use that rule type. 
I still haven't had the time to read about elementtree, my main concern 
being that Translators need a known interface to work and by using 
something like elementtree would I be tying translators to elementtree? 
Reading to be done...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The thought of getListStates is that a controlling app can find out

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know what those integers mean. I feel uncomfortable with totally 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unrestricted states, states need to follow some sort of standard 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (even if it is a State object API). The other reason for getting the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> known states is to alert the user they have requested an invalid 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state, why should YABT try and process something which simply cannot 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be translated (IE. no state exists for it)? States are causing me a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certain difficulty, rules are what actually use state, but how can a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> translator find all states from rules? Currently states are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> registered in the translator by the loader, this means that the rules 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may not actually know anything about states but the loader can tell 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the translator to accept any of the states it lists. I suppose this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separates states into two categories, those for rules, and those 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> permitted as starting states.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For some reason I do not have any difficulty with states as I do not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see why a translator - whatever that is - should know all states. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Being told them by the loader is, from my perspective, unnecessary. A 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state - being implemented as a dictionary or, if you feel a need for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hierarchical structures, a suitable recursive, simple class structure 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - is to my mind a means to store variables accessed by rules. Each 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> xml file should contain a node called init_state or so, being a child 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of root. It should be processed at load time. The corresponding 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handler function should att the dictionary to the translator so any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rule handler can access it. After initializing the state from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attributes of the init_state node, the init_state handler should 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> override it with a corresponding config section from the translator's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> config file, finally with optional arguments passed to the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constructor. Then the translator is in a well-defined state. Certain 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rule types will change some values within state. A state member could 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be used, eg., to marshall statistics on the input stream, store info 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on whether or not to use capitalization in the Braille output, define 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formats for date, time, grade 1 or 2. It would have to be discussed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if, alongside with state, there should be some sort of settings 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> influencing the behavior of rules but which the rules cannot modify. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Much of this is, I understand, already implemented in yabt, except 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the config file. That said, I really do not see why the loader 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should build up the state, rather than a node handler for init_state 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> called by some method that initializes the translator, maybe indeed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the loader, but not through proprietary code within the loader. The 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> init_state_handler would be reusable for all xml tables no matter 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what rule types they use. I wouldn't even see a problem in allowing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rules to add new variables to state, if needed. But in most cases 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this won't be necessary. With suitable rule types you could specify a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> full-featured programming language.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To distinguish state from context, I would say that each state can be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changed by certain rule types whereas context must be taken as it is. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Further, the apply method which executes the translator on a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular input, must be given a new context, whereas the state is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not necessarily modified upon each call of the translator.
</I>I am out of time, so I didn't get to read that bit about states. My 
problem is that rules don't know about translators or what translator 
instance owns them (so logng as rules aren't dynamic then they may 
actually be owned by more than one translator). On the other hand 
translators know about rules, and loaders know about both the rules and 
translator, so to achieve the short circuit of if no state can ever be 
reached of that value why even bother trying to translate? May be rules 
could throw exceptions about this. The other problem I have is allowing 
controlling apps to display possible states to users (eg. if I altered 
state to be strings or have some way of associating names to them which 
might mean something to a user) a translator must be able to get at the 
states to create this list.

Really must go now, sorry I didn't get through this. I will be away over 
the Christmas and new year, plenty of reading. I will be away over 
Christmas and new year, and also coming up in the early new year should 
be my SCJP exam, so may be I need to say I will have a short step back 
from YABT.

PS. again email length was too long for list.
