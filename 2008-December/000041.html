I'm not quite sure what you're meaning. If you mean the code in 
YABT/__init__.py, this purely defines the package namespace as one which 
may be used by other distributions. Currently not used by YABT, but 
should I feel that YABT is too much as one distribution then it could be 
split (eg. if I decide to make additional implementations which I feel 
should be optional I may make YABT.extras.egg and this still can use the 
YABT package for its own stuff).

</I>&gt;<i> whatever) to Braille, you will end up with many 2- or 3-form chars...
</I>
Probably one of those very under documented features of YABT. The 
character mapping is to lower the required rules. The mappings are run 
before translation begins, so characters which should be treated the 
same by the translator are mapped to one common character (eg. it can 
cover those cases for the variety of quote marks which visually look 
different but have the same meaning, and so on).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if addCharacterMap on top of the class hierarchy is the best 
</I>&gt;<i> choice. How about a new class at implementation level that 
</I>&gt;<i> encapsulates the whole loading and mapping staff? - Further, I wonder 
</I>&gt;<i> if base_class should really be focused on strings rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary objects.
</I>
This is slightly where python gets me, from the source code I can't tell 
really what I mean in regards to arbitary objects or strings. The 
translator classes are probagbly going to be the tightest regarding what 
the API should except as external applications will use it and shouldn't 
need to get tied up with wrapping input into objects we know will always 
work. They should just know that translators deal with strings/unicode 
and similar. I will discuss this another time.
&gt;<i> I believe that some smart people have worked on char sets before. 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.libbraille.org">http://www.libbraille.org</A> should be interesting to look at. This 
</I>&gt;<i> library does have Python bindings by the way. Should yabt use it, 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe at implementation level?
</I>
I will take a look, but one thing currently offered by the character 
mapping in YABT is that it can actually deal with more than characters 
(entire strings, so if I knew the unicode for the hyphen represented by 
-- in plain text then I could map -- to that unicode character or vice 
versa). It will end up being a balance of which offers more and which 
performs fastest (as performance is still a concern although YABT I feel 
runs fast enough I don't want to be careless and let it become slow).
&gt;<i> By the way: if you are interested in software development, you could 
</I>&gt;<i> benefit from PyContext on the pypi, at least when in a brain-storming 
</I>&gt;<i> mode as I am right now.  PyContext implements some new paradigms 
</I>&gt;<i> described in articles referred to in the README file.
</I>
More reading, I am really going to have to find a quiet corner.

I had a look on pypi to see if I could find some alternatives for 
setuptools, and just to get a general idea of some of the packages and I 
found &quot;behave&quot;. This has some interesting concepts which explain unit 
testing well. Tests are something as well as docs I feel I should get up 
to speed with for YABT.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enough for today.
</I>
Think so.
