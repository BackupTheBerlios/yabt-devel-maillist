<PRE>Hello,
I won't try and answer all of it now, I don't know if you had a chance 
of reading through those pages I referred to in another mail regarding 
dependency injection. Anyway I need to sit down properly and read and 
fully understand what you have said below.

I will make a couple quick comments:
* translators.py: line 141: Well done you found the code I missed 
removing when I did the external rules stuff. Simply ignore _Rule inner 
class, I have removed it in the last commit. The input class idea still 
exists though, an input class is a group of states, this saves having to 
list all states again and again, you can just say rule applies in any 
state in particular input class.
* Logging: this is actually one of the parts where I say configuration 
module needed, NO! The python logger has its own configuration system, 
and the YABT logger can be done through that (either by code or a config 
file), just configure the loggers of names beginning with YABT (eg. 
YABT.translators, etc, I really should have a list and document the list).
* AspectJ was something I never got round to in java and aspect 
orientated programming in python I haven't really got round to either.

I will try and get to the rest soon.

Please note this mail was originally too big for the default maximum 
size in the list configuration, I can raise it if necessary but ideally 
we should try and trim messages (I am as bad as anyone on that, so I 
can't point fingers). As I am bad enough on forgetting to trim messages 
I did allow it, and probably will continue so long as the message is on 
topic.

</I>&gt;<i> minutes to write this down, please forgive my superficiality.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't insist on the name 'engine', even if I find your rule concept 
</I>&gt;<i> stretches a bit the natural meaning of 'rule'. But let's work on this 
</I>&gt;<i> basis.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. On the loader concept
</I>&gt;<i> I see your point to the extent that you want a given translator to be 
</I>&gt;<i> abel to use different loaders and vice versa. My only response to the 
</I>&gt;<i> first point would be a dispatcher mechanism either through an 
</I>&gt;<i> (optional) argument to __init__ , or according to the file name 
</I>&gt;<i> extension (eg. xml, csv etc.). The second type of reuse (one loader 
</I>&gt;<i> for different translators) would seem to me an academic exercise but I 
</I>&gt;<i> may be wrong. But even if there are practical needs to reuse a given 
</I>&gt;<i> loader for various translators, I would assume that (multiple) 
</I>&gt;<i> inheritance is the most obvious way to reuse an existing loader. I 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot currently think of a practical need to allow the user to write 
</I>&gt;<i> a new loader complying with a particular translator's loader API. But 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no strong views on this. My only concern is that the loader 
</I>&gt;<i> concept seems somewhat awkward as it requires two steps to load a rule 
</I>&gt;<i> table: create a loader object and then pass it to the translator of 
</I>&gt;<i> your choice. These two steps may be required as you suspect for the 
</I>&gt;<i> future. But today most users would probably wonder what this is all 
</I>&gt;<i> good for. Can you think of a more convenient way, say, through 
</I>&gt;<i> a wrapper, default values for arguments etc.? - I guess the __init__ 
</I>&gt;<i> methods of subclasses would be a good place. I want to instantiate 
</I>&gt;<i> most translators just by giviny passing a filename of my favorite rule 
</I>&gt;<i> table, or even less than that (look at PyHyphen where I can write: 
</I>&gt;<i> h_uk = hyphenator('en_UK'), and the filename is constracted through a 
</I>&gt;<i> simple join. Clearly, this would require a filename convention which I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't think is appropriate here because we won't have a subclass for 
</I>&gt;<i> braille translation, but for, say, translation trees featuring a 
</I>&gt;<i> certain range of rule types.
</I>&gt;<i> On rules
</I>&gt;<i> It seems now we are closer than I'd thought yesterday.
</I>&gt;<i> This being said:
</I>&gt;<i> - I feel uncomfortable with that AddCharMapping staff in the 
</I>&gt;<i> base_class as char substitution is too specific. Further, as I wrote, 
</I>&gt;<i> char substitution should be an ordinary rule to be registered with the 
</I>&gt;<i> base class. So may I suggest you use a simple substitution rule fed 
</I>&gt;<i> either by a plain text file (as I suggested yesterday), or by a 
</I>&gt;<i> hard-coded dictionary or list of pairs.
</I>&gt;<i> - What do you mean by GetListOfStates? I believe you cannot always 
</I>&gt;<i> list all possible states as these may be unknown or indefinite. I 
</I>&gt;<i> know: a finite state michine works on a finite number of states... But 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not comfortable with this restriction as I feel a state should be 
</I>&gt;<i> defined not by an integer, but by an object containing multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> settings. Also, the name 'state' suggests that it may only refer to 
</I>&gt;<i> some property of the translator itself. However, I think we agree that 
</I>&gt;<i> state can describe any property of anything in the universe. So I 
</I>&gt;<i> would suggest to replace it by 'settings'.But the structure of 
</I>&gt;<i> settings objects would have to be defined. I guess a settings object 
</I>&gt;<i> would be a simple empty container that could store all kinds of data 
</I>&gt;<i> including settings objects for different translators or even specific 
</I>&gt;<i> subrules.
</I>&gt;<i> - bf and afcontext: This seems to be too specific as well. So why not 
</I>&gt;<i> work with a context object which may then well be a pair of two 
</I>&gt;<i> strings each representing bf- and afcontext? Or it may be a triple of 
</I>&gt;<i> humidity, temperature and air pressure in Beijing if our translator 
</I>&gt;<i> works on air-conditioning systems rather than strings. That's the 
</I>&gt;<i> beauty of dynamic typing! Just learn to love this freedom, even if it 
</I>&gt;<i> may first seem frightening to a Java programmer!
</I>&gt;<i> - translator.py, line 141: what is input class? What does this if... 
</I>&gt;<i> statement do here?
</I>&gt;<i>  - line 151: logging should go into the base class controlled by some 
</I>&gt;<i> settings. I think we do need a configuration system. You should look 
</I>&gt;<i> at docutils... and become addicted to aspect-oriented programming.
</I>&gt;<i> - - line 164: don't understand why you need the rule set class 
</I>&gt;<i> alongside with rule class.
</I>&gt;<i> - line 192: I have the feeling that you need the AddChar stuff because 
</I>&gt;<i> your rule concept is too narrow to use it for efficient char 
</I>&gt;<i> substitution. In this respect, my engine idea could be more 
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward as it encapsulates everything, even translators with 
</I>&gt;<i> hard-coded one-line algorithms rather than loadable rule tables. I 
</I>&gt;<i> guess the constructor of an engine would take only a settings 
</I>&gt;<i> argument. It has an apply method taking the input object and a context 
</I>&gt;<i> object. I would have to think more thoroughly about focus, befor and 
</I>&gt;<i> after context. My only point here is that engines would be suitable 
</I>&gt;<i> both for simple char substitution, control of air-condition systems of 
</I>&gt;<i> Beijing-based hotels and xml-based rule trees. But I must admit that 
</I>&gt;<i> your code arguably does a good job.
</I>&gt;<i> I must stop here. I'm not sure if I've convinced you to conceptualize 
</I>&gt;<i> the interaction between base_class and the rules a bit differntly. And 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not even sure if it's worth trying, even I would have written this 
</I>&gt;<i> thing in a different way, because my thinking is influenced by docutils.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I'll go on trying to convince you later this week.
</I>&gt;<i>
