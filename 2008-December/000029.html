<PRE>I have now made some alterations to the description of YABT. A bit more 
than I hoped and I probably haven't done it all. Any way I have 
committed these changes to the mercurial repository. There is one main 
thing I found which I had forgotten about and want to sort out before 
YABT-2.0b2. I haven't been touching the ChangeLog file. I think this is 
something to do with me and so I want to do one of the following:
* remove the file and just expect users to refer to the mercurial log if 
they wish to view changes.
* Find some way to connect the mercurial log with the ChangeLog, so I am 
forced to enter the details into the ChangeLog as what I enter for the 
commit message is used in ChangeLog. A mercurial extension seems to be 
the option here.

The first is simpler but those who only use releases won't have change 
information easily to hand. The second is more complete but does have 
greater work to do to implement (find the extension, where should it be 
server or local, commit or push/pull activated, etc).

I personally wouldn't miss it if it went have you any views?

This is the only issue outstanding, unless you find some in the latest 
repository commit.
