&gt;<i> Interesting article. Reminds me of the bridge pattern as described by the

</I>&gt;<i> As I remembered and from what I can find by doing a quick search online dependency injection and the bridge pattern do different things. It seems like the bridge pattern is to hide how a specific operation is actually done where as dependency injection is about how to choose what implementation should be used. Whilst I normally don't have good things to say about wikipedia, the example there does seem quite good (<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern</A>). The bridge pattern seems to fit with my loader concept (IE. all translators will want to load rules, but no translator needs to know how to actually load the rules).
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
&gt;<i> I share your view that loading a file into a translator is a fairly specific
</I>&gt;<i> process: Whereas film databases are not designed specifically for a specific
</I>&gt;<i> application that retrieves films directed by a particular director, rule
</I>&gt;<i> tables will be written for a specific translator. In theory, a two-column
</I>&gt;<i> csv file could be used by a context-sensitive xml engine: the loader would
</I>&gt;<i> just create nodes on the fly... But this is academic I think. So I would
</I>&gt;<i> assume that yabt comes up with a number of translators accomodating most
</I>&gt;<i> needs. And table authors will choose their favorite one and write a table
</I>&gt;<i> for it. I would change my mind if you wanted to allow yabt to use
</I>&gt;<i> third-party tables written for another software, say, buxbury. But in this
</I>&gt;<i> case, I would assume a one-off conversion would do well. This is another
</I>&gt;<i> difference to a public film database that changes every day as new films
</I>&gt;<i> come to light.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>Again this question of is what you feel should be provided (translators 
to do specific tasks) something which should be done right at the core 
of YABT or should it be a higher level API building on top of the low 
level API as I discussed in another email. I also argue that tables are 
not tied to particular translators. The only tie is that a table for 
translating text into another text string should only be used for a 
translator which converts text to text (Braille being text as either 
using ascii Braille or unicode Braille). It is possible for different 
text to text translators to exist, YABT has Translator and 
BufferedTranslator, but both can use the XML loader classes (either the 
file XML loader or the String XML loder), I can't see the sense of YABT 
forcing people to use the combinations I feel they need to use, hence 
the dual level API idea.
&gt;<i> As I said: I don't have strong views on loaders provided that in most cases
</I>&gt;<i> users don't need to bother for them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a dispatcher (I mentioned this in my earlier e-mail), let me give a short
</I>&gt;<i> example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> def __init__(self, location, sourcetype):
</I>&gt;<i>      loader = getattr(self, sourcetype + '_loader')
</I>&gt;<i>       self.rules = loader(location)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This allows you to specify as many loader methods as you want such as
</I>&gt;<i> ftp_loader, xml_loader, plaintext_loader etc. The init method does
</I>&gt;<i> everything through the getattr trick. And innovative prople can easily
</I>&gt;<i> extend this in subclasses to use an sqlite_loader which is called by
</I>&gt;<i> something like mytranslator = translator('mytable', 'sqlite')
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   As regards the base translator and the engines (rules), I guess there is a
</I>&gt;<i> greater need for decoupling. I would even decouple more than you as
</I>&gt;<i> described in my earlier e-mail.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>I am still unsure how to decouple safely more. Relying on a single 
method and being provided with two pieces of data seems very loosely 
coupled to me. May be I need a small working example.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Yabt-devel] Further thoughts and explainations on my design of
</I>&gt;<i> YABT
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I think I have now found some articles wich explain what I am trying to
</I>&gt;<i> do with YABT with my design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In previous messages I mentioned about spring and its configuration, yes
</I>&gt;<i> it would be wrong for YABT to provide that configuration framework, but
</I>&gt;<i> it should support being used within that framework (IE. support being
</I>&gt;<i> used by those applications). Spring is huge and may over complicate what
</I>&gt;<i> I am meaning, the part I am getting at is the inversion of control and
</I>&gt;<i> dependency injection stuff. I have had a look for some explainations of
</I>&gt;<i> it and found (<A HREF="http://wiki.python.org/moin/DependencyInjectionPattern">http://wiki.python.org/moin/DependencyInjectionPattern</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> That particular page is not so useful on its own but it has some good
</I>&gt;<i> links (Martin Fowler's article is good). I feel translators and rules
</I>&gt;<i> should be loosely coupled, translators and loaders should be loosely
</I>&gt;<i> couple but unfortunately loaders and rules may not be loosely coupled
</I>&gt;<i> (reason being that loader deals with a data source representing rules).
</I>&gt;<i> As dependency injection deals with plain old python objects (POPOs, I am
</I>&gt;<i> using this to reflect the java term POJO) then YABT doesn't need to
</I>&gt;<i> concern itself with anything of the controlling app (whether the
</I>&gt;<i> controlling app actually uses a dependency ijection framework or what
</I>&gt;<i> that framework is, or if the app just creates the objects as in yabt-trans).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The configuration module I mentioned recently where all loaders and
</I>&gt;<i> translators could register would be optional and potentially would
</I>&gt;<i> provide a replacement to the dependency injection system. The
</I>&gt;<i> configuration module would be more suited for dynamic applications where
</I>&gt;<i> users may select the loaders and translators they want (eg. the
</I>&gt;<i> controlling app might call a getTranslatorList method/function and use
</I>&gt;<i> the information returned to display a list of translators and their
</I>&gt;<i> descriptions to the user for the user to select which they want to use
</I>&gt;<i> and then the app would get an instance by calling something like
</I>&gt;<i> createTranslatorByName).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How does my structure sound now I have mentioned all this?
</I>&gt;<i>
