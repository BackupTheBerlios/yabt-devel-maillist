<PRE>As I am running out of time pre Xmas, just some quick comments:

On loaders:

I now see there is merit in the loaders module (base class and
implementations rather than just having methods).

You rightly pointed out that one of our main differences lies in that I see
base_translator more as a translator manager. So what I really think of is
one layer on top of all components (translators, loaders, exceptions and
maybe readers and writers for input and output in the future). This is due
to my bias that comes from docutils whereas yours seems to stem from java
and spring. I strongly feel that yabt would greatly benefit from having all
or most of its base classes inherit from an even more abstract component
class which handles the parsing of config files and component-specific
config sections therein, overriding general settings by more specific ones
etc. As much as I'd benefit from knowing more about spring, I anticipate it
would give you pleasure to spend some time reading through

* docutils.__init__.py defining the component class which deals with config
and logging issues
* docutils.core (where what you have called manager class (in docutils
terms: publisher) is defined)
* and maybe docutils.frontend for some other issues.

You could even envisage to simply copy and paste the component class from
docutils into yabt as it is so general and has, I think, a terrific
configuration architecture. This would calm my concerns on forcing the
caller to deal with loader objects when he just wants to instantiate a
translator. This may also mitigate your regrets for not having Spring
available.

 On the long description in setup.py:

I looked at the yabt page on the pypi. The description is not properly
rendered. I guess you forgot the blank line before the bullet list.


I see that the reply address is your private one rather than the list. So I
change it manually.
