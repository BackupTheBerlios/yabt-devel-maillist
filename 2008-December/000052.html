<PRE>Interesting article. Reminds me of the bridge pattern as described by the
Gang of Four.

I share your view that loading a file into a translator is a fairly specific
process: Whereas film databases are not designed specifically for a specific
application that retrieves films directed by a particular director, rule
tables will be written for a specific translator. In theory, a two-column
csv file could be used by a context-sensitive xml engine: the loader would
just create nodes on the fly... But this is academic I think. So I would
assume that yabt comes up with a number of translators accomodating most
needs. And table authors will choose their favorite one and write a table
for it. I would change my mind if you wanted to allow yabt to use
third-party tables written for another software, say, buxbury. But in this
case, I would assume a one-off conversion would do well. This is another
difference to a public film database that changes every day as new films
come to light.

As I said: I don't have strong views on loaders provided that in most cases
users don't need to bother for them.

As a dispatcher (I mentioned this in my earlier e-mail), let me give a short
example:

def __init__(self, location, sourcetype):
    loader = getattr(self, sourcetype + '_loader')
     self.rules = loader(location)

This allows you to specify as many loader methods as you want such as
ftp_loader, xml_loader, plaintext_loader etc. The init method does
everything through the getattr trick. And innovative prople can easily
extend this in subclasses to use an sqlite_loader which is called by
something like mytranslator = translator('mytable', 'sqlite')


 As regards the base translator and the engines (rules), I guess there is a
greater need for decoupling. I would even decouple more than you as
described in my earlier e-mail.

Subject: [Yabt-devel] Further thoughts and explainations on my design of
YABT


Hello,
I think I have now found some articles wich explain what I am trying to
do with YABT with my design.

In previous messages I mentioned about spring and its configuration, yes
it would be wrong for YABT to provide that configuration framework, but
it should support being used within that framework (IE. support being
used by those applications). Spring is huge and may over complicate what
I am meaning, the part I am getting at is the inversion of control and
dependency injection stuff. I have had a look for some explainations of
it and found (<A HREF="http://wiki.python.org/moin/DependencyInjectionPattern">http://wiki.python.org/moin/DependencyInjectionPattern</A>).
That particular page is not so useful on its own but it has some good
links (Martin Fowler's article is good). I feel translators and rules
should be loosely coupled, translators and loaders should be loosely
couple but unfortunately loaders and rules may not be loosely coupled
(reason being that loader deals with a data source representing rules).
As dependency injection deals with plain old python objects (POPOs, I am
using this to reflect the java term POJO) then YABT doesn't need to
concern itself with anything of the controlling app (whether the
controlling app actually uses a dependency ijection framework or what
that framework is, or if the app just creates the objects as in yabt-trans).

The configuration module I mentioned recently where all loaders and
translators could register would be optional and potentially would
provide a replacement to the dependency injection system. The
configuration module would be more suited for dynamic applications where
users may select the loaders and translators they want (eg. the
controlling app might call a getTranslatorList method/function and use
the information returned to display a list of translators and their
descriptions to the user for the user to select which they want to use
and then the app would get an instance by calling something like
createTranslatorByName).

How does my structure sound now I have mentioned all this?
