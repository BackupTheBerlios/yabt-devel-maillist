<PRE>On __init__.py

I've seen these setuptools magic before and as an ignorant I don't know what
it does... Doesn't matter. Does setuptools work with pydoc and such like?
Haven't checkt this. But pydocs doc browser is just cute.I'd regret if
setuptools disturbed pydoc. If you are annoyed by setuptools, just kick it
out. I've no strong views. I wouldn't mind users who love yabt for its
functionality while constantly complaining about its anti-setuptools
philosophy.

   On base_translator

    def addCharacterMap(self, orig, repl):

Char mapping is a delicate issue. Let alone the technical details: What do
we expect char mappings to do? I assume char mapings to be dependent on the
country, language, output device and maybe other circumstances I cannot
think of right now. Should this be done at the very end? Probably not.
Formatting needs to be aware of the final char set at least if certain
representations expand to more than one physical char. I.e. if you map 2000
Japanese signs (Khanji or whatever) to Braille, you will end up with many 2-
or 3-form chars...

I wonder if addCharacterMap on top of the class hierarchy is the best
choice. How about a new class at implementation level that encapsulates the
whole loading and mapping staff? - Further, I wonder if base_class should
really be focused on strings rather than arbitrary objects.

I believe that some smart people have worked on char sets before.
<A HREF="http://www.libbraille.org">http://www.libbraille.org</A> should be interesting to look at. This library
does have Python bindings by the way. Should yabt use it, maybe at
implementation level?

By the way: if you are interested in software development, you could benefit
from PyContext on the pypi, at least when in a brain-storming mode as I am
right now.  PyContext implements some new paradigms described in articles
referred to in the README file.


Enough for today.
