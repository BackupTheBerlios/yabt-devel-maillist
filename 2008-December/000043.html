<PRE>Hello,
Time to get to the really interesting stuff, in some ways I am not over 
bothered about the scripts interface, it primarily was a demonstration 
app, the internals must be right as that can affect both the script and 
useage through the API.

I had a read of what you had written, my view is mixed. I think we have 
come at it from quite different angles. I tried to put in my comments 
(in two stages &lt;MW&gt; indicates initial thoughts and &lt;MW2&gt; indicates 
thoughts after leaving it and trying to leave some of my java views behind).

I have also decided, as the approaches were so different, it might be 
worth me expressing what I am thinking (the difference is so great I 
couldn't edit in my own thoughts for the design). I have written it in 
the body of this email.

Ideally before saying technically what methods/properties classes should 
have, let's consider what it should actually do/provide.

1. Translator

A translator should:
* translate some input into an output format.
* translation should be performed according to a collection of rules.
* a translator should be able to be configured to use particular rules 
(eg. rules for text to British Braille)
* to minimise the rules required simple substitutions may be performed 
before the main translation process.
* translation should permit smooth switching between different sub-codes 
of the main code (IE. British literary Braille and British maths Braille 
are sub-codes of British Braille. This could be taken further, Braille 
is a code, British Braille and German Braille are sub-codes). The 
definition of smooth switching is where specific things should be done 
at joins, then they should actually be done without the app using YABT 
to know of this code specific join detail (eg. in British Braille 
typically an in line equation should be followed by a dot 6 if the next 
character is punctuation, the controlling app should not know that 
British Braille would require this dot 6 in this case).
* the context of the translation should be specified (IE. does this 
translation belong next to the end of a page or does it have a maths 
equation after it, etc).

2. Rules

A rule should:
* Match if the current position meets certain criteria specified in the rule
* May contain other rules which it can check (IE. it can be a filter 
rule to lower the checks to be done). In this case it should report the 
match as the sub-rule which matches.
* As a rule knows how it should match, it should perform all checks to 
confirm if it is a match (IE. it should decide from all position 
information whether it matches and disregard/ignore any information not 
required by itself).

3. Loader

It is imagined that it would be useful to have tables stored on a 
storage device (eg. hard disk, USB memory stick, etc), so something 
needs to read this data and manipulate the translator to contain the 
correct rules (it would be too much to expect application developers to 
do all this themselves and by having common code for this could 
standardise the table formats whilst allowing developers flexibility to 
use their own if they so desire).

A loader should:
* load rules into a translator according to data in a data source.
* data source should be able to be specified by the controlling app
* loaders should be reuseable (IE. both specifying a different data 
source once used and also to load data into more than one translator).

4. Configuration module

I am uncertain whether this is needed or not, but here is my views of 
what it could provide if it were to be included.

* allow loaders and translators to register with it and provide user 
friendly names
* allow an application to enquire registered loaders and translators and 
obtain user friendly details
* allow selection of loader and translator (eg. as a factory, particular 
type could be specified by name returning a relevant instance)


I know none of that is implementation specific, but I feel it may be 
best to take this extra step back. If all of the above were to be done, 
then all YABT currently lacks is the configuration module and possibly 
it could do with better manipulation of rules in a translator (I could 
do with expanding on what I mean by configuration of rules). If I have 
to go to classes (I want to get specification at this level cleared up 
first) I would say:
* Different loaders deal with different input source types
* different translators deal with different translation types (eg. text 
to Braille, XML to speech, etc).

Comments welcome.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Happy to discuss.
