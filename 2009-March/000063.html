<PRE>After recovering from the shock of suggesting subclassing str or unicode 
(shock caused by my java knowledge, String is defined as final and for 
good reasons in java, don't know whether those reasons are still valid 
for python) it should be fully possible to add a method for case 
insensetive matching to unicode. The big question is what approach will 
be the most efficient for YABT? For speed reasons I sway towards copying 
the input to an upper case (or lower case if for some reason that would 
be better) and then leave it to the rule to choose which to compare to. 
I don't know how the internals of java's String class works for the 
equalsIgnoreCase method, but the way I would do it in python would 
involve conversion to upper case, this probably would have to happen 
every time the method is called and so might get expensive for YABT's 
speed. May be somewhere between the two is the answer.

I am not sure whether a translation manager system would resolve the 
issue I am referring to by saying about the &quot;mess&quot;. I actually think the 
use of the word mess was meaning lots of complicated stuff which I 
didn't want to try and explain at that time of night could occur and 
lead to unexpected results. If I build on the example used when I 
originally said that (where one loader said preprocessing should change 
lowercase &quot;a&quot; to capital &quot;A&quot; and another loader being used in the same 
translator says capital &quot;A&quot; should be preprocessed to lowecase &quot;a&quot;, 
order of loading doesn't really matter), let's say we want to translate 
the phrase &quot;A quarter to four&quot;. After preprocessing we end up with &quot;a 
quArter to four&quot; (only one preprocessing rule/character mapping can be 
applied to any given character). This string doesn't conform to either 
loader's rules expectation (by implication of the preprocessing one 
expects only lowercase &quot;a&quot; and the other only expects capital &quot;A&quot; but 
the input still contains a mix of lowercase and capital letter &quot;a&quot; and 
they don't even match with where we originally put them). This basically 
means neither set of rules will work fully as expected. The only real 
ways out I can see are either forbid preprocessing (may be not a bad 
thing) or make it only apply for certain sets of rules (IE. those from a 
particular loader, this would certainly call for the RuleSet idea).

The problem is no table knows about any other table which might be used 
in the same translator, so no preprocessing can be guaranteed as things 
stand.

This looseness between tables/loaders is good in one way but in another 
it does cause problems as YABT will need to lay down the laws for what 
they should and should not do so that they may work together without 
issue (as I feel multiple loaders is a good thing in the main).

I do see some advantages of the translation manager system but feel that 
there are some core issues which really need some attention in YABT 
first. May be I should place down some tasks and a rough plan for what 
version what should happen. I do foresee a huge overhaul of the table 
format, main rule system, etc coming up.
