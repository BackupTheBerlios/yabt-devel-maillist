<PRE>Hello,
I hope the word substitution is what you mean, there are some 
limitations to it (eg. only single words (IE. could not do the 
translation for &quot;of the&quot; in British Braille due to the space between 
words), unable to deal with words containing punctuation (eg. words 
containing apostrophy like &quot;he's&quot;, &quot;you'll&quot;, etc or may be hyphenated 
words (eg. this lists name &quot;yabt-devel&quot;)) and other limitations possibly 
not the fault of this substitution system directly (eg. having to 
conform with character mappings from the main rule system means case 
insensitive or possibly more accurately requires the definitions to be 
capitalised).

So where does this put YABT? First of all it prooves that hybrid 
translation can be done. This has highlighted further problems with the 
original rule system (IE. character mappings) along with the ones 
already known (eg. requiring all rules to be defined in the correct 
order, creating the correct rules being difficult, potentially requires 
huge number of rules, etc). How ever I feel there are some advantages of 
the main rule system (eg. very flexible to specify exactly under what 
circumstances a translation should occur, nonspecific to a particular 
system (eg. not specific for Braille), etc).

What should be done? Ideally it needs to maintain the flexibility for 
specifying conditions for which a translation should occur. An easier to 
maintain system would be better (eg. no dependency on order of rules 
specified, potentially simpler context specifying (may be even aliases 
for commonly used ones like for beginning of word, etc), etc) and then 
improvements for character handling like capitalisation (ideally I want 
to get rid of character mappings from the Translator classes).

I probably should go back and do some rereading, but how might your rule 
system from a tree fit in with the above points/comments?

Any thoughts on how to work around the character mapping/preprocessing 
problem (IE. currently rule system X could break rule system Y if both 
used together as X can modify character mappings Y sets or vice versa?

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I have finally got back to writing some more of YABT. I have now made a
</I>&gt;<i> simple word substitution dictionary system for the translator (currently
</I>&gt;<i> only in mercurial). To use this feature look at the -d (--dictionary)
</I>&gt;<i> option in the yabt-trans command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short when using the -d option when YABT performs the translation it
</I>&gt;<i> first checks to see if a simple word substitution is possible, if there
</I>&gt;<i> is one then it just makes the substitution and moves on to the next
</I>&gt;<i> chunk of text, but if it doesn't have a substitution then it will check
</I>&gt;<i> through the rules as usual.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The word substitution dictionary files are plain text files containing
</I>&gt;<i> three columns separated by whitespace. First column should be an integer
</I>&gt;<i> and should be the state in which the substitution can be made. The
</I>&gt;<i> second column is the original word (Please remember define in capitals
</I>&gt;<i> if working with the britishtobrl.xml rules as everything is converted to
</I>&gt;<i> capitals because of britishtobrl.xml's character maps, this may not
</I>&gt;<i> apply for other tables). The third column is the substitution. Any
</I>&gt;<i> line(s) not conforming to this in a dictionary file will be ignored.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This word substitution system may not be optimised, it may not be as
</I>&gt;<i> flexible as it should, etc, I don't even know how much practical use it
</I>&gt;<i> will be. After saying all that, which really doesn't sell this, it is
</I>&gt;<i> done primarily as a proof of concept to demonstrate how multiple loaders
</I>&gt;<i> could be used to create a hybrid translation system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any thoughts on this? Where might YABT go with this? If this
</I>&gt;<i> word substitution dictionary system isn't of great practical use what
</I>&gt;<i> might be?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also I am wanting to do more work on the main rule system (the one
</I>&gt;<i> britishtobrl.xml is a table for). This covers things like the table
</I>&gt;<i> format, should certain things be moved from that table format (eg. the
</I>&gt;<i> character maps), etc?
