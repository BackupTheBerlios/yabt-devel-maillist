<PRE>Hello,
I have finally got back to writing some more of YABT. I have now made a 
simple word substitution dictionary system for the translator (currently 
only in mercurial). To use this feature look at the -d (--dictionary) 
option in the yabt-trans command.

In short when using the -d option when YABT performs the translation it 
first checks to see if a simple word substitution is possible, if there 
is one then it just makes the substitution and moves on to the next 
chunk of text, but if it doesn't have a substitution then it will check 
through the rules as usual.

The word substitution dictionary files are plain text files containing 
three columns separated by whitespace. First column should be an integer 
and should be the state in which the substitution can be made. The 
second column is the original word (Please remember define in capitals 
if working with the britishtobrl.xml rules as everything is converted to 
capitals because of britishtobrl.xml's character maps, this may not 
apply for other tables). The third column is the substitution. Any 
line(s) not conforming to this in a dictionary file will be ignored.

This word substitution system may not be optimised, it may not be as 
flexible as it should, etc, I don't even know how much practical use it 
will be. After saying all that, which really doesn't sell this, it is 
done primarily as a proof of concept to demonstrate how multiple loaders 
could be used to create a hybrid translation system.

Is there any thoughts on this? Where might YABT go with this? If this 
word substitution dictionary system isn't of great practical use what 
might be?

Also I am wanting to do more work on the main rule system (the one 
britishtobrl.xml is a table for). This covers things like the table 
format, should certain things be moved from that table format (eg. the 
character maps), etc?
