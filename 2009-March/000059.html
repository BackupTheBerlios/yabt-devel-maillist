<PRE>Hi,

sounds great! It is useful indeed to allow users to prescribe specific
translations of individual words such as names. All translation programs I
am aware of feature this.
Once yabt becomes open to different rule types and a tree structure of rules
as discussed a few months ago, I am prepared to work on German rules. I
would even implement new rule types once I understand how to. But as things
stand, I believe it is not yet possible.

Occasionally I work on a package I've called 'transcribo'. One day it should
be able to work as a plain text layout engine using different front ends
that work as bridges to input sources such as docutils, ODF processing
libraries etc. Of course, each element of the input tree can specify its own
translator such as YABT and its wrapper such as textwrap or my little hack
(textwrap2) that embeds hyphenation. I hope that if things go well,
transcribo will be able to format things like headings, lists, enumerations,
multi-column text, page references, headers, footers etc. Styles will be
stored in json files...

I am not even half way there, but I am getting closer. It may still take a
few weeks or months though to publish a demonstration version. With a few
docutils directives or interpreted text roles this could make up a beautiful
mixed content typesetting system for plain text and Braille by 2050...

The other day I was thinking of how to hyphenate contracted Braille. Could
one create specific dictionaries for PyHyphen? I would think so if one uses
an appropriate character mapping that does not interfere with control chars
used by the hyphenation library.

 If you are still interested in Spring, you may wish to look at

Betreff: [Yabt-devel] Multiple loaders and other translation algorithms


Hello,
I have finally got back to writing some more of YABT. I have now made a
simple word substitution dictionary system for the translator (currently
only in mercurial). To use this feature look at the -d (--dictionary)
option in the yabt-trans command.

In short when using the -d option when YABT performs the translation it
first checks to see if a simple word substitution is possible, if there
is one then it just makes the substitution and moves on to the next
chunk of text, but if it doesn't have a substitution then it will check
through the rules as usual.

The word substitution dictionary files are plain text files containing
three columns separated by whitespace. First column should be an integer
and should be the state in which the substitution can be made. The
second column is the original word (Please remember define in capitals
if working with the britishtobrl.xml rules as everything is converted to
capitals because of britishtobrl.xml's character maps, this may not
apply for other tables). The third column is the substitution. Any
line(s) not conforming to this in a dictionary file will be ignored.

This word substitution system may not be optimised, it may not be as
flexible as it should, etc, I don't even know how much practical use it
will be. After saying all that, which really doesn't sell this, it is
done primarily as a proof of concept to demonstrate how multiple loaders
could be used to create a hybrid translation system.

Is there any thoughts on this? Where might YABT go with this? If this
word substitution dictionary system isn't of great practical use what
might be?

Also I am wanting to do more work on the main rule system (the one
britishtobrl.xml is a table for). This covers things like the table
format, should certain things be moved from that table format (eg. the
character maps), etc?
