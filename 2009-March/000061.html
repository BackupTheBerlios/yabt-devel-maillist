<PRE>Hello,
I think from reading your response that you misunderstood what I meant 
by character mappings. Character mappings is probably a bad term for me 
to use as it is used at other stages of Braille production to the one I 
am meaning, a better term might be the preprocessing of the text (for 
the rest of this email and hopefully for future ones I will keep to the 
term preprocessing for what I am meaning).

The preprocessing currently permits substitution of characters before 
translation starts. The idea of this was taken from BrailleTrans 
(<A HREF="http://alasdairking.me.uk/brailletrans">http://alasdairking.me.uk/brailletrans</A>) and is partly done to save on 
number of rules (eg. lowercase letters can be transformed to uppercase 
characters so that rules don't need to be defined for cases containing 
uppercase letters, lowercase letters or even a combination of both 
uppercase and lowercase letters). The problem with this approach is that 
capitalisation information is lost when we do this substitution befor 
translation. While brailletrans doesn't deal with capitalisation at the 
moment I believe the information of type of character is stored some how 
in a byte associated with the character. I made the mistake of believing 
that this information byte for each character was to assist with the 
context pattern matching system used in BrailleTrans only and so did not 
implement it as regex would serve as well (possibly better than a custom 
one I could create) but I missed the capitalisation issue.

While the preprocessing is mainly used for letters to make it case 
insensitive, BrailleTrans does actually use it to substitute some 
punctuation characters.

To just explain why this causes more problems as is than just the 
capitalisation issue. Preprocessing happens before any rule sees the 
translation string, in fact before any translation starts to happen the 
whole input string is preprocessed. So let's have two loaders X and Y. 
If X is loaded first and sets a preprocessing mapping so that &quot;A&quot; is 
replaced with &quot;a&quot; and then loader Y is loaded and that sets a 
preprocessing mapping for &quot;a&quot; to &quot;A&quot; then we hit a mess when trying to 
apply the actual translation rules (this example needs more explaining 
than I originally thought). Rules from loader X expect lowercase letter 
&quot;a&quot; (this is implied by the preprocessing as if X was used alone then 
all capital &quot;A&quot; would be preprocessed to lowercase) but loader Y set 
preprocessing to convert lowercase &quot;a&quot; to capital &quot;A&quot; so we will get 
capital &quot;A&quot; coming into the string for translation. We are getting a 
conflict of interests from different loaders.

This is why I am now thinking preprocessing should not occur, or if it 
really must, it shouldn't happen in the global Translator class (it 
should be for a specific rule, although that sounds processor/time 
intensive).

I am thinking one way round would be remove preprocessing and have an 
option in the table which could say whether a rule is case sensetive or 
not and then case sensetive matches would be used or not as appropriate. 
I don't believe I have seen case insensetive matching in python for 
strings/unicode, I am quite certain java does (java plug done). If 
python doesn't have such a feature then may be two versions of the input 
string could be held, one all in uppercase and one as original 
(uppercase version used for case insensetive matches and the original 
for case sensetive matches).

I believe capitals are the main issue here, the repeated punctuation 
characters aren't such a problem as there are less of them. As an 
example: take the word &quot;error&quot;, if all matches are case sensetive then 
we need to define rules for:
error
Error
ERROR
and possibly more if we wanted to cover:
eRROR, ERror, ERRor, etc (if they really should be contracted). So at 
least for beginning contractions we have trebled the number of 
contractions, that's why case insensetive matches are good!

Enough of all that, hope it makes the description of what I had been 
calling character maps clearer. I suggest the output from tables should 
be either NABCC (ascii Braille) or the unicode Braille characters, 
unless the format should be otherwise due to the type of translation 
(eg. speech output preparation wouldn't make sense to be output in 
unicode Braille, just stick to standard ascii text or unicode for that 
format).

That took longer than I expected so will get back about any other points.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I hope the word substitution is what you mean, there are some
</I>&gt;<i> limitations to it (eg. only single words (IE. could not do the
</I>&gt;<i> translation for &quot;of the&quot; in British Braille due to the space between
</I>&gt;<i> words), unable to deal with words containing punctuation (eg. words
</I>&gt;<i> containing apostrophy like &quot;he's&quot;, &quot;you'll&quot;, etc or may be hyphenated
</I>&gt;<i> words (eg. this lists name &quot;yabt-devel&quot;)) and other limitations possibly
</I>&gt;<i> not the fault of this substitution system directly (eg. having to
</I>&gt;<i> conform with character mappings from the main rule system means case
</I>&gt;<i> insensitive or possibly more accurately requires the definitions to be
</I>&gt;<i> capitalised).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So where does this put YABT? First of all it prooves that hybrid
</I>&gt;<i> translation can be done. This has highlighted further problems with the
</I>&gt;<i> original rule system (IE. character mappings) along with the ones
</I>&gt;<i> already known (eg. requiring all rules to be defined in the correct
</I>&gt;<i> order, creating the correct rules being difficult, potentially requires
</I>&gt;<i> huge number of rules, etc). How ever I feel there are some advantages of
</I>&gt;<i> the main rule system (eg. very flexible to specify exactly under what
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances a translation should occur, nonspecific to a particular
</I>&gt;<i> system (eg. not specific for Braille), etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What should be done? Ideally it needs to maintain the flexibility for
</I>&gt;<i> specifying conditions for which a translation should occur. An easier to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain system would be better (eg. no dependency on order of rules
</I>&gt;<i> specified, potentially simpler context specifying (may be even aliases
</I>&gt;<i> for commonly used ones like for beginning of word, etc), etc) and then
</I>&gt;<i> improvements for character handling like capitalisation (ideally I want
</I>&gt;<i> to get rid of character mappings from the Translator classes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I probably should go back and do some rereading, but how might your rule
</I>&gt;<i> system from a tree fit in with the above points/comments?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts on how to work around the character mapping/preprocessing
</I>&gt;<i> problem (IE. currently rule system X could break rule system Y if both
</I>&gt;<i> used together as X can modify character mappings Y sets or vice versa?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Betreff: [Yabt-devel] Multiple loaders and other translation algorithms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have finally got back to writing some more of YABT. I have now made a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple word substitution dictionary system for the translator (currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only in mercurial). To use this feature look at the -d (--dictionary)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> option in the yabt-trans command.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In short when using the -d option when YABT performs the translation it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first checks to see if a simple word substitution is possible, if there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is one then it just makes the substitution and moves on to the next
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chunk of text, but if it doesn't have a substitution then it will check
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through the rules as usual.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The word substitution dictionary files are plain text files containing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> three columns separated by whitespace. First column should be an integer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and should be the state in which the substitution can be made. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second column is the original word (Please remember define in capitals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if working with the britishtobrl.xml rules as everything is converted to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capitals because of britishtobrl.xml's character maps, this may not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> apply for other tables). The third column is the substitution. Any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> line(s) not conforming to this in a dictionary file will be ignored.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This word substitution system may not be optimised, it may not be as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flexible as it should, etc, I don't even know how much practical use it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be. After saying all that, which really doesn't sell this, it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done primarily as a proof of concept to demonstrate how multiple loaders
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be used to create a hybrid translation system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there any thoughts on this? Where might YABT go with this? If this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> word substitution dictionary system isn't of great practical use what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might be?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also I am wanting to do more work on the main rule system (the one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> britishtobrl.xml is a table for). This covers things like the table
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> format, should certain things be moved from that table format (eg. the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> character maps), etc?
