<PRE>Some potentially superfluous remarks:

1. The state should be settable at instantiation time so it functions as a
default when calling the translator subsequently. For v3.x I would prefer
not to allow to set states when calling the translator, because it is
cleaner to separate these two tasks. Also, you should think about whether
specifying the state through calling translate() is for one-off use or
permanently such as when calling the set method. I would advocate one-off
use which helps when writing a non-contractable name amidst a contracted
text. . This feature might be worth retaining in v3.0. But offering two ways
to do the same thing only confuses the reader.

2. I don't quite understand what you mean by allowing objects of arbitrary
types (which is good!) as states and then signing integers to these (which
sounds somewhat strange). I would imagine the tables may refer to a specific
state which entails comparisons etc. My hunch is that if table authors like
non-integers as states at the expense of speed, so be it and vice versa. So
why should you care about speed here? I don't think there is much to gain.
Well, you will have good reasons... Have you looked at using the hash method
in this context?

3. While these small features are useful, the killing comes with 3.0 and
custom node types / rules. I won't repeat myself here.

Betreff: [Yabt-devel] YABT 2.1 development started


Hello,
I have decided to back away from some of the things being discussed for
YABT 3.0 and decided to add some features which have been requested
which could go in YABT 2.1.

The main feature I have done at the moment is made it possible for users
to use a setter for the state rather than have to specify it on the call
to translate, although should you wish to still call translate with the
state option you can, its now a keyword option.

The aim of YABT 2.1 is to add features, but it should still allow
applications designed for YABT 2.0 to work without any change (ideally)
or very minimal change. However as features are being added, those
making use of new features in YABT 2.1 will not be able to use YABT
2.0.x, unless they specifically try and support it in another way.

Another feature I would like to add is named states. Now I am referring
to them as named states specifically as for performance reasons I don't
want to lift the internal restriction of states being integers, instead
an object will be accepted and then assigned an integer (or some other
type should I feel it might be better with that) as an ID. Therefore the
user of YABT will have the appearance of states being of any type they
like, but internally YABT will be using state IDs. This won't break
backwards compatibility as integers will still be accepted (may be used
as the ID or may be assigned its own ID).

Adding cursor positioning and position information would be nice, but I
am not quite so sure how it might be done without breaking backwards
compatibility.

Any other thoughts of features which could be added?
