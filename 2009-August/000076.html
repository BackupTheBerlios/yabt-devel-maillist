<PRE>Hello,
I have decided to back away from some of the things being discussed for 
YABT 3.0 and decided to add some features which have been requested 
which could go in YABT 2.1.

The main feature I have done at the moment is made it possible for users 
to use a setter for the state rather than have to specify it on the call 
to translate, although should you wish to still call translate with the 
state option you can, its now a keyword option.

The aim of YABT 2.1 is to add features, but it should still allow 
applications designed for YABT 2.0 to work without any change (ideally) 
or very minimal change. However as features are being added, those 
making use of new features in YABT 2.1 will not be able to use YABT 
2.0.x, unless they specifically try and support it in another way.

Another feature I would like to add is named states. Now I am referring 
to them as named states specifically as for performance reasons I don't 
want to lift the internal restriction of states being integers, instead 
an object will be accepted and then assigned an integer (or some other 
type should I feel it might be better with that) as an ID. Therefore the 
user of YABT will have the appearance of states being of any type they 
like, but internally YABT will be using state IDs. This won't break 
backwards compatibility as integers will still be accepted (may be used 
as the ID or may be assigned its own ID).

Adding cursor positioning and position information would be nice, but I 
am not quite so sure how it might be done without breaking backwards 
compatibility.

Any other thoughts of features which could be added?
