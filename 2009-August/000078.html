<PRE>Hello,
Some good points. Yes I agree the really big differences should come 
with 3.0, my thought is should it happen yet or should some of these 
more smaller (possibly finer points) be worked out first and then when I 
move on to YABT 3.0 I should be very clear on the basics and so not hit 
annoying core definitions (how should state be seen, etc).

Also may be my plan of 2.1 would fit better with java development (sorry 
for bringing it up, but may be if I say how I was thinking then a more 
pythonic way can be found). You mention having too many ways of doing 
the same thing can become confusing, its this choice in python which is 
as much its strength as its weakness. Simply put the choice means you 
are more likely to find something to do what you want, but you may need 
to consider whether you will get conflicts with the alternatives, and 
possibly each alternative may not have the size of community to make it 
really good. Anyway one way to solve this choice issue in one particular 
package (IE. YABT) would be that in YABT 2.1 the old calling style may 
be marked as deprecated, so new users know that if they are working with 
YABT 2.1 or higher then they shouldn't use deprecated calls in YABT 2.1. 
This is where I feel java may work better, as optional args aren't 
possible in java you have multiple definitions of a method (overloading 
the method) and any particular definition of the method can be marked as 
deprecated (IE. we could mark translate with state specified as 
deprecated, but the definitions of translate which don't have state 
would not be deprecated). Any thoughts on how this can be done in python?

Now going to the questions themselves:
State: This is very tricky and its why I am wanting to work it out 
fully. It is possible for a rule to actually alter the state (eg. you 
can have embedded commands, and one could switch grade of Braille). The 
question is whether when a rule does this, should that state become the 
translators new default state? IE. if we call translate again without 
giving a state should it be the one the last call to translate resulted 
in or should we resort back to the one set explicitly with the state setter?

Now for the question of state types: it probably is a matter of 
implementation and not necessarily something which should have great 
discussion. As I said if assigning an ID to assist with performance then 
this should be as transparent as possible and should only concern those 
working on internals of YABT. The thought of using hash, well if my java 
definitions of the hashcode method is correct then this wouldn't do for 
an ID. The java hashcode contract goes something like: if two objects 
are considered equal (IE. equals method returns true) then their 
hashcodes must be the same. If two hashcodes are the same this does not 
mean that the objects are equal (IE. if the hashcodes are the same it 
does not mean that equals will return true). The use of hashcodes is to 
assist in finding objects in a collection (eg. in hashmap). In 
collections using hashcodes, the objects are sorted into groups where 
each group has the same hashcode, this means that when you come to 
retrieve the object only that hashcode group needs to be searched, so in 
a ideal case where hashcode is calculated well only a small part of the 
collection is searched.

In short an ID should be unique to equal objects but hashcode doesn't 
meet this requirement. However may be I could make use of __eq__ (I 
think that's python's version of equals).

OK, finally: you mention about the node rule system, still trying to 
fully grasp the idea. May be I have got confused along the way. I think 
you had been suggesting to use a node visitor pattern. I had a look 
about this (more related to the document processing and docutils) and a 
little unsure of what it does in python and whether docutils has got it 
the best way. In plasTeX rather than having a node visitor type, you 
simply add functions/methods to a dictionary (keys being strings 
representing the node names it should apply to (node names roughly 
relate to the LaTeX commands) and the values are the functions/methods). 
The functions/methods should accept one argument (obviously methods 
should accept self as well) and this argument is the node to be worked 
on. Now plasTeX does one thing I am not fully sure how it works, but to 
tell plasTeX to continue rendering below the node you simply call 
unicode(node) and catch the unicode returned and place this in your 
output text you return from the function. I am not quite sure why 
docutils goes with the more traditional node visitor pattern (IE. 
requiring a NodeVisitor class) which may be needed for static languages 
like java but seems a bit unnecessary for python.

Anyway I think that's enough from me, it went on longer than expected. I 
think this state setting/state meaning thing needs sorting out, I'm not 
fully happy with how it works either.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I have decided to back away from some of the things being discussed for
</I>&gt;<i> YABT 3.0 and decided to add some features which have been requested
</I>&gt;<i> which could go in YABT 2.1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main feature I have done at the moment is made it possible for users
</I>&gt;<i> to use a setter for the state rather than have to specify it on the call
</I>&gt;<i> to translate, although should you wish to still call translate with the
</I>&gt;<i> state option you can, its now a keyword option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The aim of YABT 2.1 is to add features, but it should still allow
</I>&gt;<i> applications designed for YABT 2.0 to work without any change (ideally)
</I>&gt;<i> or very minimal change. However as features are being added, those
</I>&gt;<i> making use of new features in YABT 2.1 will not be able to use YABT
</I>&gt;<i> 2.0.x, unless they specifically try and support it in another way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another feature I would like to add is named states. Now I am referring
</I>&gt;<i> to them as named states specifically as for performance reasons I don't
</I>&gt;<i> want to lift the internal restriction of states being integers, instead
</I>&gt;<i> an object will be accepted and then assigned an integer (or some other
</I>&gt;<i> type should I feel it might be better with that) as an ID. Therefore the
</I>&gt;<i> user of YABT will have the appearance of states being of any type they
</I>&gt;<i> like, but internally YABT will be using state IDs. This won't break
</I>&gt;<i> backwards compatibility as integers will still be accepted (may be used
</I>&gt;<i> as the ID or may be assigned its own ID).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Adding cursor positioning and position information would be nice, but I
</I>&gt;<i> am not quite so sure how it might be done without breaking backwards
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any other thoughts of features which could be added?
</I>&gt;<i>
