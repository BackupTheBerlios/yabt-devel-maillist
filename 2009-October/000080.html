<PRE>Hello,

1. Is there a reason to develop yabt while there is liblouis?

Yes, there are many, even if I don't know if they are compelling:
- YABT is pure Python, liblouis difficult-to-compile C staff (at least on
Windows there are problems. OK, they have a win32 dll for download, but it
is still somdwhat difficult to get going unless you obtain the Python
bindings from NVDA). OK, not very compelling for win32 users, nor for Unix
as they can always compile C.

- YABT's architecture, once finalized for 3.0 is by magnitudes more flexible
and powerful than that of liblouis. I should reiterate that yabt should have
support for liblouis tables to offset its first-mover advantage. Once you
have all liblouis tables on board, the user base will quickly grow.

- yabt is written in an easy-to-learn scripting language rather than tedious
C. I have the impression that this is the reason why liblouis is not
community-driven. Only the tables are. But here I may be wrong.

2. Setup tools / distributed

There is also virtualenv. But frankly I would subscribe to the idea of
droping setuptools. I guess distutils has its own test command. And if not,
just call the scripts in the test subdir. If yabt itself has no
dependencies, anyone who has setuptools installed can get yabt using
easy_install. That's enough of convenience I think. And even if yabt had
dependencies such as lxml, it would suffice to have an application that uses
setuptools and gets yabt and lxml upon installation.

3. Develop YABT on P3k?

Yes, good idea. You can backport it to 2.x on an as-needed basis once you
are comfortable with the architecture.

4. License

Don't know. I find it obscene though that people must pay for most assistive
software such as Duxbury. I tend to use the GPL as I am too lazy to look for
something else. But the idea of publishing always the sources does appeal to
me.

Betreff: [Yabt-devel] Future of YABT, where is it going


Hello,
I firstly have to say that YABT has been pushed to the back for some
time and really deserves some more attention. There are a few things I
want to discuss.

One of the reasons why YABT has been ignored is that there seems to be a
bit of promise from liblouis/liblouisxml on the British maths Braille
support. YABT was created because I felt at the time there was no
suitable Braille translator for BrlTex to use to produce British maths
Braille. I had looked at liblouis to see whether I could do anything but
I have to say I never really got into it (never really got to understand
it and was unsure whether it really could do what I wanted) so it seemed
easier to create my own translator and YABT came into existence. As
liblouis/liblouisxml now offers the British maths Braille support some
of the motivation has gone (I am still to assess how suitable
liblouis/liblouisxml really are). However I do feel there are certain
design features of YABT which make it better than liblouis (eg. separate
rule classes, a way to specify a function to call on no rule being
found, etc). As some of this might be hard to add to liblouis there may
still be good reasons to keep YABT under development. Any views?

Another thing is that I have come across distribute which in its 0.6.x
branch intends to be a replacement for setuptools. Now one feature
distribute offers is python3 support, so I have had the chance to try
YABT on python3 and there seems to be no issue (at least in the core
code). I feel python3 support would be something good to offer, its
almost tempting (particularly with the low number of dependencies YABT
has) to switch to having python3 as the primary development version of
python and just keep python2 support for as long as possible. However in
the past there has been question of whether I should rid YABT of that
setuptools dependency, well after coming across distribute and what I
found on the distutils-sig mailing list in the last couple of days I
have reached the conclusion that YABT must rid itself of that
setuptools/distribute dependency as quick as possible. What might be
affected by this decision:

* Running of tests, at present setuptools provides the test command to
run tests, YABT will need to provide its own.
* Automatic script generation, is this really such a loss? In future I
will just have to use the script stuff in distutils.
* YABT won't be in an egg, translation tables will be just in the
package tree, this probably means adjusting some code (eg. in the scripts).
* YABT will finally be dependency free, it will only need python and the
standard python packages.

Any alterations I have missed? Again any views on dropping the
dependency on setuptools?

I feel YABT hasn't had the attention from me, so may be time for a
project structure alteration. This would start with finding a more
relaxed license, may be the artistic 2.0 license, may be an MPL type
license (eg. EPL). Part of the reason I want to relax the license is
that I would like other developers to feel they can contribute and if
suitable people come forward I would consider adding them to the YABT
project. Essentially I would like YABT to become a bit more open and
community driven. Something I would hope that would come out of that
would be a greater user base, as hopefully development would be faster
and there could be better ideas for what YABT can do. Any views,
particularly related to licensing, I want to choose a license which will
best suit everyone's needs not just mine.
