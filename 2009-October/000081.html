<PRE>Good sounds like my thoughts make sense to more than just me. I feel 
point one is only really going to make sense if those big changes which 
should happen do happen, as YABT currently stands it doesn't have a huge 
advantage over liblouis.

Regarding setuptools then it should be a fairly easy task to create a 
distutils test command, there unfortunately isn't one but in the past I 
have written scripts to run tests so it should purely be linking 
distutils to the code to execute a test. This is probably a high 
priority as dropping setuptools support almost depends on this (yes 
could drop the support and then do this but it would leave a temporary 
gap in the feature.

Py3k being the starting point for YABT 3.0 seems a bold step but I think 
this might be a good way. Hopefully with correct coding style supporting 
both shouldn't be an issue as YABT won't depend on anything else and so 
won't be forced by other packages to the versions of python it supports.

Finally on license, essentially I want to have it that YABT code should 
stay opensource, but one thing I don't want to do is restrict people to 
what license they can release their programs under just because they use 
YABT. As an example the GPL has a requirement that anything that links 
to it should give users all the right of the GPL, and as I understand it 
that this must then continue all the way down the chain (IE. so anything 
which uses a package which uses YABT would also need to give users the 
GPL rights, and then if something uses this again that needs to give the 
users the same rights). This as I understand it even applies to when a 
package does an import (that is meant to be as good as linking), that 
seems just wrong. The artistic 2.0 license seems to be a fairly easy to 
read license and does mainly what I want. The MPL/EPL and such like also 
seem to do what I want but seem to give slightly different rights (I 
think, they aren't so simple in their language, that they allow people 
to modify the package and any new files they add to the package can be 
closed source) so I think a bit more free to users further down the 
chain, they may not protect YABT quite so well. I think that the 
artistic license is GPL compatible but I am not so sure about MPL and 
EPL, so the artistic license would be better to let YABT mix with 
software written by those who feel they must use the GPL.

I will leave it there before I start on my rant of why not use the GPL 
and why its so bad and possibly not as free as its supporters suggest, 
the above probably gives you a good idea what I would be thinking of anyway.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Is there a reason to develop yabt while there is liblouis?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, there are many, even if I don't know if they are compelling:
</I>&gt;<i> - YABT is pure Python, liblouis difficult-to-compile C staff (at least on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows there are problems. OK, they have a win32 dll for download, but it
</I>&gt;<i> is still somdwhat difficult to get going unless you obtain the Python
</I>&gt;<i> bindings from NVDA). OK, not very compelling for win32 users, nor for Unix
</I>&gt;<i> as they can always compile C.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - YABT's architecture, once finalized for 3.0 is by magnitudes more flexible
</I>&gt;<i> and powerful than that of liblouis. I should reiterate that yabt should have
</I>&gt;<i> support for liblouis tables to offset its first-mover advantage. Once you
</I>&gt;<i> have all liblouis tables on board, the user base will quickly grow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - yabt is written in an easy-to-learn scripting language rather than tedious
</I>&gt;<i> C. I have the impression that this is the reason why liblouis is not
</I>&gt;<i> community-driven. Only the tables are. But here I may be wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Setup tools / distributed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is also virtualenv. But frankly I would subscribe to the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> droping setuptools. I guess distutils has its own test command. And if not,
</I>&gt;<i> just call the scripts in the test subdir. If yabt itself has no
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies, anyone who has setuptools installed can get yabt using
</I>&gt;<i> easy_install. That's enough of convenience I think. And even if yabt had
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies such as lxml, it would suffice to have an application that uses
</I>&gt;<i> setuptools and gets yabt and lxml upon installation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Develop YABT on P3k?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, good idea. You can backport it to 2.x on an as-needed basis once you
</I>&gt;<i> are comfortable with the architecture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. License
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't know. I find it obscene though that people must pay for most assistive
</I>&gt;<i> software such as Duxbury. I tend to use the GPL as I am too lazy to look for
</I>&gt;<i> something else. But the idea of publishing always the sources does appeal to
</I>&gt;<i> me.

</I>&gt;<i> Betreff: [Yabt-devel] Future of YABT, where is it going
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I firstly have to say that YABT has been pushed to the back for some
</I>&gt;<i> time and really deserves some more attention. There are a few things I
</I>&gt;<i> want to discuss.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the reasons why YABT has been ignored is that there seems to be a
</I>&gt;<i> bit of promise from liblouis/liblouisxml on the British maths Braille
</I>&gt;<i> support. YABT was created because I felt at the time there was no
</I>&gt;<i> suitable Braille translator for BrlTex to use to produce British maths
</I>&gt;<i> Braille. I had looked at liblouis to see whether I could do anything but
</I>&gt;<i> I have to say I never really got into it (never really got to understand
</I>&gt;<i> it and was unsure whether it really could do what I wanted) so it seemed
</I>&gt;<i> easier to create my own translator and YABT came into existence. As
</I>&gt;<i> liblouis/liblouisxml now offers the British maths Braille support some
</I>&gt;<i> of the motivation has gone (I am still to assess how suitable
</I>&gt;<i> liblouis/liblouisxml really are). However I do feel there are certain
</I>&gt;<i> design features of YABT which make it better than liblouis (eg. separate
</I>&gt;<i> rule classes, a way to specify a function to call on no rule being
</I>&gt;<i> found, etc). As some of this might be hard to add to liblouis there may
</I>&gt;<i> still be good reasons to keep YABT under development. Any views?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing is that I have come across distribute which in its 0.6.x
</I>&gt;<i> branch intends to be a replacement for setuptools. Now one feature
</I>&gt;<i> distribute offers is python3 support, so I have had the chance to try
</I>&gt;<i> YABT on python3 and there seems to be no issue (at least in the core
</I>&gt;<i> code). I feel python3 support would be something good to offer, its
</I>&gt;<i> almost tempting (particularly with the low number of dependencies YABT
</I>&gt;<i> has) to switch to having python3 as the primary development version of
</I>&gt;<i> python and just keep python2 support for as long as possible. However in
</I>&gt;<i> the past there has been question of whether I should rid YABT of that
</I>&gt;<i> setuptools dependency, well after coming across distribute and what I
</I>&gt;<i> found on the distutils-sig mailing list in the last couple of days I
</I>&gt;<i> have reached the conclusion that YABT must rid itself of that
</I>&gt;<i> setuptools/distribute dependency as quick as possible. What might be
</I>&gt;<i> affected by this decision:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Running of tests, at present setuptools provides the test command to
</I>&gt;<i> run tests, YABT will need to provide its own.
</I>&gt;<i> * Automatic script generation, is this really such a loss? In future I
</I>&gt;<i> will just have to use the script stuff in distutils.
</I>&gt;<i> * YABT won't be in an egg, translation tables will be just in the
</I>&gt;<i> package tree, this probably means adjusting some code (eg. in the scripts).
</I>&gt;<i> * YABT will finally be dependency free, it will only need python and the
</I>&gt;<i> standard python packages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any alterations I have missed? Again any views on dropping the
</I>&gt;<i> dependency on setuptools?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel YABT hasn't had the attention from me, so may be time for a
</I>&gt;<i> project structure alteration. This would start with finding a more
</I>&gt;<i> relaxed license, may be the artistic 2.0 license, may be an MPL type
</I>&gt;<i> license (eg. EPL). Part of the reason I want to relax the license is
</I>&gt;<i> that I would like other developers to feel they can contribute and if
</I>&gt;<i> suitable people come forward I would consider adding them to the YABT
</I>&gt;<i> project. Essentially I would like YABT to become a bit more open and
</I>&gt;<i> community driven. Something I would hope that would come out of that
</I>&gt;<i> would be a greater user base, as hopefully development would be faster
</I>&gt;<i> and there could be better ideas for what YABT can do. Any views,
</I>&gt;<i> particularly related to licensing, I want to choose a license which will
</I>&gt;<i> best suit everyone's needs not just mine.
