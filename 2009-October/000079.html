<PRE>Hello,
I firstly have to say that YABT has been pushed to the back for some 
time and really deserves some more attention. There are a few things I 
want to discuss.

One of the reasons why YABT has been ignored is that there seems to be a 
bit of promise from liblouis/liblouisxml on the British maths Braille 
support. YABT was created because I felt at the time there was no 
suitable Braille translator for BrlTex to use to produce British maths 
Braille. I had looked at liblouis to see whether I could do anything but 
I have to say I never really got into it (never really got to understand 
it and was unsure whether it really could do what I wanted) so it seemed 
easier to create my own translator and YABT came into existence. As 
liblouis/liblouisxml now offers the British maths Braille support some 
of the motivation has gone (I am still to assess how suitable 
liblouis/liblouisxml really are). However I do feel there are certain 
design features of YABT which make it better than liblouis (eg. separate 
rule classes, a way to specify a function to call on no rule being 
found, etc). As some of this might be hard to add to liblouis there may 
still be good reasons to keep YABT under development. Any views?

Another thing is that I have come across distribute which in its 0.6.x 
branch intends to be a replacement for setuptools. Now one feature 
distribute offers is python3 support, so I have had the chance to try 
YABT on python3 and there seems to be no issue (at least in the core 
code). I feel python3 support would be something good to offer, its 
almost tempting (particularly with the low number of dependencies YABT 
has) to switch to having python3 as the primary development version of 
python and just keep python2 support for as long as possible. However in 
the past there has been question of whether I should rid YABT of that 
setuptools dependency, well after coming across distribute and what I 
found on the distutils-sig mailing list in the last couple of days I 
have reached the conclusion that YABT must rid itself of that 
setuptools/distribute dependency as quick as possible. What might be 
affected by this decision:

* Running of tests, at present setuptools provides the test command to 
run tests, YABT will need to provide its own.
* Automatic script generation, is this really such a loss? In future I 
will just have to use the script stuff in distutils.
* YABT won't be in an egg, translation tables will be just in the 
package tree, this probably means adjusting some code (eg. in the scripts).
* YABT will finally be dependency free, it will only need python and the 
standard python packages.

Any alterations I have missed? Again any views on dropping the 
dependency on setuptools?

I feel YABT hasn't had the attention from me, so may be time for a 
project structure alteration. This would start with finding a more 
relaxed license, may be the artistic 2.0 license, may be an MPL type 
license (eg. EPL). Part of the reason I want to relax the license is 
that I would like other developers to feel they can contribute and if 
suitable people come forward I would consider adding them to the YABT 
project. Essentially I would like YABT to become a bit more open and 
community driven. Something I would hope that would come out of that 
would be a greater user base, as hopefully development would be faster 
and there could be better ideas for what YABT can do. Any views, 
particularly related to licensing, I want to choose a license which will 
best suit everyone's needs not just mine.
