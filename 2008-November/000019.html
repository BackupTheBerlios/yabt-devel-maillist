<PRE>Hello,
I feel this really needs to be sorted so I created a task in the task 
manager to explain what needs to be done.

The task is #4271 in YABT's task manager and is planned to be solved by 
next Friday (although sooner would be better). Ideally the development 
versions I feel should go like this:
Repository commits are pre-release versions. The reason for this way 
round is that should I find a bug with a previous version I can insert a 
bug fix intermediate release (eg. if someone finds a problem with 
YABT-2.0.0 but I have started development on YABT-2.0.1 then I can 
create YABT-2.0.0update1 which would come before any development version 
of YABT-2.0.1). If I were using post version development numbers then 
how could I do this safely as in the previous example I would be working 
on YABT-2.0.0rXX. Possibly it could be done if I studied in detail the 
setuptools version rules (eg. if alphabetic order matters then may be I 
could use patch instead of update in the version as p comes before r, 
but this is working very close to the limit and a careless mistake could 
find it failing). The only occasion I might want post release 
development versions is for a maintainance branch.

The reason all this comes up is I rather like the way hgversion works to 
figure out all the version info from the repository (inspecting tags, 
and if no repository is found then it assumes it must be a source 
distribution in which case it uses PKG-info (or what ever the package 
data file is which is included in source distributions)). Due to all 
this figuring it out from the repository it obviously can't do 
pre-release revision numbering as no tag exists for the up coming 
release, so it just uses post-release revisions. If the patch rather 
than update scheme would work then hgversion looks like a good system to 
go with as it already exists. If I were to create a modified version of 
hgversion to fit what I really would want then it probably would not 
work everything out, but at least would be as good as the setuptools 
support for SVN revision numbering. Also by not relying on tags it means 
that should a tag wish to be created for a non-version reason then it 
won't mess up the version numbering.

Any thoughts?

Also I have realised what was making me so certain there was a 
connection between berlios and sourceforge, berlios uses some of the 
sourceforge project management tools.
