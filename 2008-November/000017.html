<PRE>Unless newer Python versions do not support newer xml specifications,
I'm already convinced that form feed (and probably other chars) are
forbidden in xml files.

However, apart from an esthetic aspect (= better reflecting the limits
of the xml specification in the tree structure) I do not currently see
any advantage of your choice over the unicode-like notation. The
latter would probably yield faster execution as less nodes have to be
processed. The tables become smaller, the code also is smaller as you
don't need to handle the special nodes that are only there to store
meta info on form feed etc. The usual python code that handles context
strings by comparing them with the relevant xml attributes could be
used because the unicode notation would be consistent across the board
such that string comparisons etc. would work smoothly.

I wonder if there is something I have overlooked. If not, I would
probably vote for the \uxxx notation in future versions. Another
advantage of the latter would be that authoring tables would probably
be less painful.

Happy to discuss.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I really want to get YABT-2.0b2 pushed out. It shouldn't change much
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from what it is. It really is a marker point in development.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Particular points up for discussion/action:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * That XML format... I feel it could be improved so much. particular
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> points for alteration are:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> input class - Should this be an element? I feel this could become an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> attribute of rule. Also should I remove the limit of input class being
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just an int? Initial reason was done in YABT-1.0 for performance, but we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> now are doing less state checks so performance impact should be less now.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> final state - The same questions as input class.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Context types - should the context type name become an attribute of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> context elements (bfcontext and afcontext)? This then removes the 2
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> character limit for type names, and names could be more meaningful, eg.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> always instead of ^a.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As for the question of supporting control characters like form feed, my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mind is not settled on that. Whilst things like form feed should really
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be the responsibility of applications, what about lazy text translation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems such as YABT_translate command? Also more importantly, I feel
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that context strings should support these control characters, as whilst
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the controlling app may handle the actual form feed, it possibly would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> want to tell YABT this translation happens at the end of a page. Whether
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the braille code (or other translation) actually has any differentce
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> should not be of any concern to the application.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My feeling is that the XML change should happen, whether before or after
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> YABT-2.0b2 I don't mind.
