<PRE>I must admit I do not currently anticipate a huge demand on the part
of developers to have separate packages for the core and an xml-based
implementation. Of course I would be convinced by some evidence with
similar projects. But off hand I would say most people would be happy
with an integral package of both core and some useful implementations.
So nested repositories appear to me a luxury if not superfluous at
this stage. Look at projects like numpy, scipy and indeed docutils
which ship with all kinds of packages and subpackages in a single
distribution and I haven't heard of any plans to move towards nested
repositories. To the contrary: Sphinx is a good example of a
substantial extension / implementation of docutils and it is used as
from Python 2.6 and 3.0 as the standard Python documentation tool. Or
have a look at rst2pdf which also builds on docutils rather than just
docutils.core or whatever might be considered a useful subset to be
released separately.

That said, I certainly think that nested repositories could have
important advantages. But I perceive a risk of being cide-tracked by
all these issues even way before the first reasonably stable
implementation of yabt is in sight. By the way, my fealing is that a
considerable portion of yabt would be replaced by new code. So maybe a
version 3.0 could make sense rather than coercing this substantial
rewrite between v2beta2 and v2.0final.

One of my favorite English sayings is: &quot;Let's cross that bridge when
we come to it.&quot;. And many bridges can be avoided just by staying away
from the forest.

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to get up to date with my emails.

</I>&gt;<i> Setuptools:
</I>&gt;<i> My reasoning of setuptools over distutils:
</I>&gt;<i> * Setuptools can manage dependencies for YABT (if any). If YABT was to
</I>&gt;<i> be split into YABT.core and an implementation(s), then the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation(s) will require YABT.core if they are distributed in
</I>&gt;<i> separate egg files. Also this assists developers using YABT for a task
</I>&gt;<i> in their applications (eg. if I structured BrlTex correct to use
</I>&gt;<i> setuptools then it could add YABT as a dependency).
</I>&gt;<i> * Setuptools and plugins for setuptools can provide file tracking. I
</I>&gt;<i> mean that you don't need to create the manifest file to specify
</I>&gt;<i> additional files to be included in source distributions, so long as they
</I>&gt;<i> exist in the repository then setuptools (or for mercurial the
</I>&gt;<i> hg.setuptools plug in) will automatically create the manifest file for you.
</I>&gt;<i> * version management. Setuptools will allow multiple version of YABT to
</I>&gt;<i> be installed and the correct version to be used in applications.
</I>&gt;<i> * Entry points to support plugins. This feature allows developers to
</I>&gt;<i> specify entry points in their egg files and setuptools automatically
</I>&gt;<i> manages this. See how hg.setuptools is done as a plugin for setuptools,
</I>&gt;<i> it only requires the user to install hg.setuptools for setuptools to
</I>&gt;<i> support mercurial repositories (no configuration required).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure that there may be other advantages I have just missed. I also
</I>&gt;<i> will admit setuptools does have its problems (no obvious way to
</I>&gt;<i> uninstall packages, etc) so I am willing to look at alternatives if
</I>&gt;<i> anyone can suggest better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now for those versioning questions:
</I>&gt;<i> Forest looks like it would solve YABT's requirements, but I still have
</I>&gt;<i> some questions in my mind as to how or what things are for (eg. does the
</I>&gt;<i> server need the forest extension, does every person using the repository
</I>&gt;<i> need the forest extension, what happens if they don't have it if it is
</I>&gt;<i> needed, what are the snapshot files for, etc). The other thing is that
</I>&gt;<i> on the forest extension's page there is a link to a proposal for adding
</I>&gt;<i> module support to mercurial. Unfortunately there is no clue as to when
</I>&gt;<i> this might happen. An interesting thing I do notice is that git does
</I>&gt;<i> seem to have a submodules system, might we be better served by git
</I>&gt;<i> (there is a git setuptools plugin)? It also comes back to the question,
</I>&gt;<i> should YABT.core be a separate egg to a YABT implementation made by the
</I>&gt;<i> YABT project? Creating it as one egg does solve the issue of mercurial
</I>&gt;<i> and the separation can still be achieved with python packages inside one
</I>&gt;<i> egg, but separating into different packages would show how
</I>&gt;<i> implementations should be done by external developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for naming the implementation packages, I selected YABT.braille as I
</I>&gt;<i> want somewhere YABT to be obvious as to what it can be used for, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than a library which looks so arbitary you can't really work out what it
</I>&gt;<i> does. May be I was skipping a layer when thinking this, the people
</I>&gt;<i> deciding to use a YABT implementation is not a end user, but a developer
</I>&gt;<i> who hopefully can understand what YABT's potential is and doesn't need
</I>&gt;<i> uses spelling out. Those developers using YABT in their application are
</I>&gt;<i> the ones making YABT fit a users actual needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel some of these distribution questions should be answered before
</I>&gt;<i> progressing with YABT (except for making that YABT-2.0b2 release) as if
</I>&gt;<i> a restructure of the repository is needed I don't want to have to do it
</I>&gt;<i> in the midst of developing YABT and potentially having work flow
</I>&gt;<i> severely disrupted.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Firstly notes about version numbers. I said earlier I fall on the side
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the date for development builds, that I am now reconsidering. Problem
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> being the date given is for when the build is done, not when the commit
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> into the repository is done (IE. if I build immediately after committing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> revision 66 on 2008-11-26 but you were to build revision 65 on the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> following day (2008-11-27) then according to version numbers you have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the newer version where as I in fact have the later committed version).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> May be I will just have to go with customising hgversion.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Another problem I am hitting is that hg.setuptools and probably
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hgversion only work when at the top level directory in mercurial. It
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> seems like one distribution per repository (I can see the sense).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Question goes, is there a way to split up one distribution in setup.py,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> so it produces two eggs (one for YABT.core and one for YABT.braille).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> May be I will just have to resort to using the manifest files. The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alternative is if there is a way to cluster more than one repository
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inside a repository. I can't remember exactly what the forest extension
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> does for mercurial but it does something to do with clustering
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> repositories (either making multiple repos appear as one or hopefully
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one contain multiple repos). I will try and hunt it out. SVN didn't have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this problem, but I feel it did have other problems that DVCs solve.
