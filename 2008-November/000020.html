<PRE>I am not deeply into this versioning stuff so I trust you in opting for a
pragmatic solution. For PyHyphen I don't care about version numbers. I don't
even tag revisions as I don't expect anyone but developers accessing the
repos. Those who want to install PyHyphen - whether through setuptools or
otherwise - should use the version on the pypi. But I know this is not very
sophisticated; you may even find it ridiculous.

That said, I've stumbled over your remark that commits should be pre-release
versions. I must admit I am accustomed to much more frequent commits. My
only project so far is PyHyphen and I am the only developer. Some commits I
made were only roughly tested. But for some reason I feel better if some
changes I make are savely stored on googlecode. Maybe this is just because
my PC is a pre-historc model from 2001 A.D.

So should you want me to make commits only if the code is ready for
pre-release, I would have to change my habits which I'd do for good reasons.
Maybe the fact that we are two developers is such a reason. For now though,
I would prefer making commits to a development branch whenever I want.

I'd be grateful for some clarification.

Betreff: [Yabt-devel] Task for creating versioning number scheme created


Hello,
I feel this really needs to be sorted so I created a task in the task
manager to explain what needs to be done.

The task is #4271 in YABT's task manager and is planned to be solved by
next Friday (although sooner would be better). Ideally the development
versions I feel should go like this:
Repository commits are pre-release versions. The reason for this way
round is that should I find a bug with a previous version I can insert a
bug fix intermediate release (eg. if someone finds a problem with
YABT-2.0.0 but I have started development on YABT-2.0.1 then I can
create YABT-2.0.0update1 which would come before any development version
of YABT-2.0.1). If I were using post version development numbers then
how could I do this safely as in the previous example I would be working
on YABT-2.0.0rXX. Possibly it could be done if I studied in detail the
setuptools version rules (eg. if alphabetic order matters then may be I
could use patch instead of update in the version as p comes before r,
but this is working very close to the limit and a careless mistake could
find it failing). The only occasion I might want post release
development versions is for a maintainance branch.

The reason all this comes up is I rather like the way hgversion works to
figure out all the version info from the repository (inspecting tags,
and if no repository is found then it assumes it must be a source
distribution in which case it uses PKG-info (or what ever the package
data file is which is included in source distributions)). Due to all
this figuring it out from the repository it obviously can't do
pre-release revision numbering as no tag exists for the up coming
release, so it just uses post-release revisions. If the patch rather
than update scheme would work then hgversion looks like a good system to
go with as it already exists. If I were to create a modified version of
hgversion to fit what I really would want then it probably would not
work everything out, but at least would be as good as the setuptools
support for SVN revision numbering. Also by not relying on tags it means
that should a tag wish to be created for a non-version reason then it
won't mess up the version numbering.

Any thoughts?

Also I have realised what was making me so certain there was a
connection between berlios and sourceforge, berlios uses some of the
sourceforge project management tools.
