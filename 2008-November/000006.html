<PRE>Hello,
Firstly notes about version numbers. I said earlier I fall on the side 
of the date for development builds, that I am now reconsidering. Problem 
being the date given is for when the build is done, not when the commit 
into the repository is done (IE. if I build immediately after committing 
revision 66 on 2008-11-26 but you were to build revision 65 on the 
following day (2008-11-27) then according to version numbers you have 
the newer version where as I in fact have the later committed version). 
May be I will just have to go with customising hgversion.

Another problem I am hitting is that hg.setuptools and probably 
hgversion only work when at the top level directory in mercurial. It 
seems like one distribution per repository (I can see the sense). 
Question goes, is there a way to split up one distribution in setup.py, 
so it produces two eggs (one for YABT.core and one for YABT.braille). 
May be I will just have to resort to using the manifest files. The 
alternative is if there is a way to cluster more than one repository 
inside a repository. I can't remember exactly what the forest extension 
does for mercurial but it does something to do with clustering 
repositories (either making multiple repos appear as one or hopefully 
one contain multiple repos). I will try and hunt it out. SVN didn't have 
this problem, but I feel it did have other problems that DVCs solve.
