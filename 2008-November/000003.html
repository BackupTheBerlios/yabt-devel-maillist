<PRE>OK. On the core and underlying translator subclasses (implementations)
don't know a good word for it:

I don't know where you stand, i.e. if you have any concrete picture of
what the core should do. So I share my ideas at the risk of
duplication of work.

I would anticipate that the core is to be seen as a layer between the
overarching app such as rst2brl, and the concrete implementation of
the translator (I guess we will have an implementation for xml-based
translation, another for json, yet another for CSV files, maybe
another one for an awk-based translator or whatever).

So what should the core export to the overarching app?

I think just a translator class which expects the caller to specify
which implementation to use, and optionally some settings overriding
the implementation's defaults, should be enough. The settings dict
could have general settings applicable to all implementations, and
some implementation-specific ones, i.e. the core will be unaware of
these. The core should, however, manage default settings, overriding,
handling of config files etc. Maybe the core could also provide
information to the app on the available implementations, xml files
etc. The settings could contain info on the xml file to use, the
translation grade etc.

The core.translator should then export a method to actually call the translator.

What should such an apply method require in terms of arguments? I
guess at least an optional settings dictionary and a unicode string,
possibly a sequence of settings and strings in arbitrary order.

Further to my previous e-mail: rule types (i.e. nodes) could check for
specific settings and even modify them through handler methods
accessing the settings dict.

By the way: another example of translation (maybe you meant this)
would be: translation of a text into phonems for speech output (rather
than just preparing the text itself for speech output as done by orca
etc. when processing html pages...)

Happy to discuss.
