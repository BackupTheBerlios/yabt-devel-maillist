<PRE>My earlier proposal not published on this list was as follows:

At the first level of the tree there are only rules checking for the length
of the original (i.e. substring to be translated by a single contraction).
So there are likely nor more than 5 to 10 nodes. On the second level I
suggested rules checking for the beginning or the end of the word to single
out contractions that may apply under such circumstances. But as most
contractions can occur anywhere, this wouldn't reduce the problem very much.
For the third level I suggested to check in alphabetical order if the
substring matches any of the originals in the nodes. If so, the contraction
may be used unless some excemption contained in the subtree of that
contraction applies.

Today, an alternative algorithm came to my mind and I want to quickly expose
the idea so it is retained:

We sort all contractions alphabetically using the original (eg: &quot;that&quot; or
&quot;sh&quot;). We arrange them in the tree as follows: At the first level (i.e.
root's children) each node corresponds to the first character of the
originals. So there are around 26 nodes. The contraction for &quot;always&quot; will
occur in the first node, &quot;but and because in the second and so forth. At
level 2 we distinguish according to the second char of the original. Here,
we are likely to have much less nodes as, e.g. there are no contractions
whose original starts with &quot;aa&quot; or &quot;jk&quot;. The depth of the tree is equal to
the length of the longest original. Walking through the input string char by
char will guide us to the longest contraction which might apply. The subtree
of that contraction may then contain exemptions such as with &quot;gateshead&quot;. If
an exemption applies, there may still be a shorter contraction encountered
on our way up to here. So we'll have to backtrack and check if that one
applies.

At a given level, each node must be checked until the char matches. This may
take long if the current letter is &quot;z&quot;. To speed up things, one may consider
binary search in cases where there are many nodes. Another option is to
assemble the chars in each node to a string functioning as an index to the
nodes of each level. The index string for level 1 is likely to contain the
entire alphabet. At level 2, most strings will have much less characters.
Choosing the right node comes down to searching the position where the
character occurs in the index string.

I don't know if this algorithm is smarter than the previous one. Its
downside might be that it disregards the context until a specific
contraction is singled out. In most cases, however, the described iterative
matching may yield good approximations.

We may reconsider both alternatives when discussing which node types to
implement.
