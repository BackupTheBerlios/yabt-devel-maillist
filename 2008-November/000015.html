<PRE>I think it's a good idea to release 2.0b2 as soon as possible if only
to open up our minds for the big bang that the new architecture will
mean. So I tend to making only the urgent changes, leave the xml
structure as it is stable.

On 3.0 or 2.1: you are right: everything will depend on how much the
API will change. And on that I have no clou either. So let's cross
that bridge...

On form feed: you are right: context strings should be able to contain
anything including form feed. But even if xml does not allow to have
these characters in attributes, there should be better workarounds
then children. I could think of escape chars in strings, or certain
flags. I think it is really really worthwhile doublechecking if xml
really doesn't allow any utf8 char. json does!

  Please release 2.0b2 asap so we get ready for the big bang and make
yabt quickly the most compelling tool in its field...

By the way: Have you received any feedback from yabt users, if any? I
am optimistic you will have a lot once yabt works with end user apps.

It may be useful to look at a tool to convert openoffice docs into
braille. there is a package on the pypi making available the xml
structure of oo docs to Python... You see my point?

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I really want to get YABT-2.0b2 pushed out. It shouldn't change much

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Particular points up for discussion/action:
</I>&gt;<i> * That XML format... I feel it could be improved so much. particular
</I>&gt;<i> points for alteration are:
</I>&gt;<i> input class - Should this be an element? I feel this could become an
</I>&gt;<i> attribute of rule. Also should I remove the limit of input class being
</I>&gt;<i> just an int? Initial reason was done in YABT-1.0 for performance, but we
</I>&gt;<i> now are doing less state checks so performance impact should be less now.
</I>&gt;<i> final state - The same questions as input class.
</I>&gt;<i> Context types - should the context type name become an attribute of the
</I>&gt;<i> context elements (bfcontext and afcontext)? This then removes the 2
</I>&gt;<i> character limit for type names, and names could be more meaningful, eg.
</I>&gt;<i> always instead of ^a.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the question of supporting control characters like form feed, my
</I>&gt;<i> mind is not settled on that. Whilst things like form feed should really
</I>&gt;<i> be the responsibility of applications, what about lazy text translation
</I>&gt;<i> systems such as YABT_translate command? Also more importantly, I feel
</I>&gt;<i> that context strings should support these control characters, as whilst
</I>&gt;<i> the controlling app may handle the actual form feed, it possibly would
</I>&gt;<i> want to tell YABT this translation happens at the end of a page. Whether
</I>&gt;<i> the braille code (or other translation) actually has any differentce
</I>&gt;<i> should not be of any concern to the application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My feeling is that the XML change should happen, whether before or after
</I>&gt;<i> YABT-2.0b2 I don't mind.
