Yes except I don't want the license to make YABT so restricted that 
nobody can use it.

I feel minimal should be passed in to the constructor. May be this is to 
do with some of my java knowledge, and the spring framework and how its 
configuration works.

As for state itself, this is something which I feel is fairly core. For 
Braille translation YABT uses it for Braille grade, and this may vary 
between calls. Why not use separate translators for different grades? I 
believe smoother joins can be done if a single translator can move from 
one to the other as it knows about both grades and so can deal with the 
context around a grade change. Another use for the state could be in 
preparation of text for a speech synthesiser, it could denote 
punctuation level, abreviation level, etc. In fact for speech 
preparation more than just state might be wanted, or state may be a 
tuple in that case (mixed feelings here, may be the statically typed 
language side of me is going, NO! how could you have state being two 
different types?). State if not needed by a particular translation 
system need not actually be used, the variable can just be left floating 
about.

Looking at this state issue further it seems possibly very problematic. 
State I believe does belong to the translator (IE. I want to translate 
in this state) but rules need to access state. If state can be different 
types (or other properties are set dynamically) how does any particular 
rule type know what it should find (IE. how to stop things just falling 
apart?).

I also have noticed something I really should get the list to reply to 
the list by default.
