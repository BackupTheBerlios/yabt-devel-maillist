<PRE>So the issue is trickier than I had thought.

Currently I hope that ElementTree (should we use it at all) will deal with
control characters at load time, at least as from Python 2.6. I further hope
that the element attributes exported by ElementTree come with normal control
characters that don't require special treatment. Should ElementTree deceive
me in this respect, I would still prefer to work with special attributes
within the same node rather than having special nodes for control
characters. But in the latter case I wouldn't have strong views anymore
except we agreed that each node should contain a rule.

  Betreff: Re: [Yabt-devel] YABT-2.0b2


  Hello,
  To confirm the problem of the form feed character I tried inserting the
character into an XML file (authoring by hand) using the notation &amp;#x0c;
which is the XML way of representing characters by number but this still
fails when parsing (I was fairly sure of this, but I wanted to check).

  by using the \uXXXX notation we would need to handle this in YABT's
loader, as the python string representation when loaded would naturally be
u'\\u000c'. I couldn't actually say without trying, but I would imagine
doing this parsing would be slower as all strings would need checking where
as the &lt;char&gt; element code is only run when the parser finds a &lt;char&gt;
element. Other than the fact that it might feel more natural to a table
author as the \uXXXX notation is used elsewhere I don't quite understand how
you mean it would make things smoother (the string comparisons, etc). It is
the job of the loader to get around these format specific issues, the
current working is that the loader upon encountering a &lt;char&gt; element
replaces it with a python string of that value (admittedly confusingly ord
should be decimal rather than hex, I probably should correct that).

  I think this really should be left until post YABT-2.0b2 before
adding/correcting.

Unless newer Python versions do not support newer xml specifications,
I'm already convinced that form feed (and probably other chars) are
forbidden in xml files.

However, apart from an esthetic aspect (= better reflecting the limits
of the xml specification in the tree structure) I do not currently see
any advantage of your choice over the unicode-like notation. The
latter would probably yield faster execution as less nodes have to be
processed. The tables become smaller, the code also is smaller as you
don't need to handle the special nodes that are only there to store
meta info on form feed etc. The usual python code that handles context
strings by comparing them with the relevant xml attributes could be
used because the unicode notation would be consistent across the board
such that string comparisons etc. would work smoothly.

I wonder if there is something I have overlooked. If not, I would
probably vote for the \uxxx notation in future versions. Another
advantage of the latter would be that authoring tables would probably
be less painful.

Happy to discuss.

  The only possible changes I would want to make to YABT-2.0b2 excluding
XML stuff is descriptions for YABT in the setup file. Currently it is
very Braille specific eg. YABT (Yet another braille translator) is the
short description and the long description is equally bBraille
orientated only hinting at other uses.

If I was to permit XML changes (keeping backward compatability) would be
to add an include statement, but I don't know at this moment how much
work it might take to really implement it. As time is unknown, I would
give it the thumbs down for YABT-2.0b2.

I am fairly certain on the XML limitation. I asked someone I know about
it, I did a google search and for the version of XML the python parsers
support it just won't take it. It isn't UTF8 characters which are the
problem, its these control characters in ASCII (eg. form feed, there are
others but this is one I really know about) and some other unicode
characters not used much. This is a limitation of the XML version used,
it is fixed by other XML versions (I mean by XML versions the actual XML
specification as defined at the top of documents eg.
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;
not the languages implementation of parsers). The only fixes I could
find suggested online were to use a child element as I have, use the
newer version of XML (except python doesn't support this) or create some
internal mark up (eg. the python \uXXXX notation in unicode strings). I
opted for the child element as this then fitted with XML notation. If
you need convincing about this lack of support, try creating XML using
the DOM packages (eg. minidom) and then use the toxml method to create
the XML string and then parse that, it will fail if you inserted a form
feed when creating a #text node in forming the original DOM.

    I think it's a good idea to release 2.0b2 as soon as possible if only
to open up our minds for the big bang that the new architecture will
mean. So I tend to making only the urgent changes, leave the xml
structure as it is stable.

On 3.0 or 2.1: you are right: everything will depend on how much the
API will change. And on that I have no clou either. So let's cross
that bridge...

On form feed: you are right: context strings should be able to contain
anything including form feed. But even if xml does not allow to have
these characters in attributes, there should be better workarounds
then children. I could think of escape chars in strings, or certain
flags. I think it is really really worthwhile doublechecking if xml
really doesn't allow any utf8 char. json does!

   Please release 2.0b2 asap so we get ready for the big bang and make
yabt quickly the most compelling tool in its field...

By the way: Have you received any feedback from yabt users, if any? I
am optimistic you will have a lot once yabt works with end user apps.

It may be useful to look at a tool to convert openoffice docs into
braille. there is a package on the pypi making available the xml
structure of oo docs to Python... You see my point?

      Hello,
I really want to get YABT-2.0b2 pushed out. It shouldn't change much
from what it is. It really is a marker point in development.

Particular points up for discussion/action:
* That XML format... I feel it could be improved so much. particular
points for alteration are:
input class - Should this be an element? I feel this could become an
attribute of rule. Also should I remove the limit of input class being
just an int? Initial reason was done in YABT-1.0 for performance, but we
now are doing less state checks so performance impact should be less now.
final state - The same questions as input class.
Context types - should the context type name become an attribute of the
context elements (bfcontext and afcontext)? This then removes the 2
character limit for type names, and names could be more meaningful, eg.
always instead of ^a.

As for the question of supporting control characters like form feed, my
mind is not settled on that. Whilst things like form feed should really
be the responsibility of applications, what about lazy text translation
systems such as YABT_translate command? Also more importantly, I feel
that context strings should support these control characters, as whilst
the controlling app may handle the actual form feed, it possibly would
want to tell YABT this translation happens at the end of a page. Whether
the braille code (or other translation) actually has any differentce
should not be of any concern to the application.

My feeling is that the XML change should happen, whether before or after
YABT-2.0b2 I don't mind.
