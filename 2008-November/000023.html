<PRE>I think you misunderstood the meaning of pre-release and post-release. I 
will stick with how it works in SVN, to explain what I meant, as commit 
numbers in SVN are simpler than mercurial which uses commit numbers and 
(I think) SHA1 hashes to mark revisions.

If it is a pre-release revision the version number might read as 
2.0.1.dev-R477, which means development version before 2.0.1 at revision 
477. It indicates that the version is working towards version 2.0.1. If 
I was to use post release eg. 2.0.0-r477, this notation means revision 
477 after the 2.0.0 release. The implication of this is your building on 
top of 2.0.0. Version (commit) 2.0.1.dev-r477 certainly comes after any 
version number starting 2.0.0, so certainly comes after 2.0.0-r477, 
2.0.0.1, 2.0.0update1 and so on. These pre or post release 
versions/revisions are to denote every commit between the actual 
releases, so commit as much as you like is the theory.

I am coming down on the side of pre-release revisions as this indicates 
where things are going rather than where it has come from. I don't think 
it will take me much work to create a module to retrieve this 
information from the mercurial repository (as mercurial is python and 
hgversion is very small and looks easy to understand). So unless you 
have some strong feelings on this, I will go this way.

I hope that clears it up. May be read the setuptools documentation about 
continual releases/development versions if you want more details or a 
different explaination.

</I>&gt;<i> Betreff: [Yabt-devel] Task for creating versioning number scheme created
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I feel this really needs to be sorted so I created a task in the task
</I>&gt;<i> manager to explain what needs to be done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The task is #4271 in YABT's task manager and is planned to be solved by
</I>&gt;<i> next Friday (although sooner would be better). Ideally the development
</I>&gt;<i> versions I feel should go like this:
</I>&gt;<i> Repository commits are pre-release versions. The reason for this way
</I>&gt;<i> round is that should I find a bug with a previous version I can insert a
</I>&gt;<i> bug fix intermediate release (eg. if someone finds a problem with
</I>&gt;<i> YABT-2.0.0 but I have started development on YABT-2.0.1 then I can
</I>&gt;<i> create YABT-2.0.0update1 which would come before any development version
</I>&gt;<i> of YABT-2.0.1). If I were using post version development numbers then
</I>&gt;<i> how could I do this safely as in the previous example I would be working
</I>&gt;<i> on YABT-2.0.0rXX. Possibly it could be done if I studied in detail the
</I>&gt;<i> setuptools version rules (eg. if alphabetic order matters then may be I
</I>&gt;<i> could use patch instead of update in the version as p comes before r,
</I>&gt;<i> but this is working very close to the limit and a careless mistake could
</I>&gt;<i> find it failing). The only occasion I might want post release
</I>&gt;<i> development versions is for a maintainance branch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason all this comes up is I rather like the way hgversion works to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out all the version info from the repository (inspecting tags,
</I>&gt;<i> and if no repository is found then it assumes it must be a source
</I>&gt;<i> distribution in which case it uses PKG-info (or what ever the package
</I>&gt;<i> data file is which is included in source distributions)). Due to all
</I>&gt;<i> this figuring it out from the repository it obviously can't do
</I>&gt;<i> pre-release revision numbering as no tag exists for the up coming
</I>&gt;<i> release, so it just uses post-release revisions. If the patch rather
</I>&gt;<i> than update scheme would work then hgversion looks like a good system to
</I>&gt;<i> go with as it already exists. If I were to create a modified version of
</I>&gt;<i> hgversion to fit what I really would want then it probably would not
</I>&gt;<i> work everything out, but at least would be as good as the setuptools
</I>&gt;<i> support for SVN revision numbering. Also by not relying on tags it means
</I>&gt;<i> that should a tag wish to be created for a non-version reason then it
</I>&gt;<i> won't mess up the version numbering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also I have realised what was making me so certain there was a
</I>&gt;<i> connection between berlios and sourceforge, berlios uses some of the
</I>&gt;<i> sourceforge project management tools.
