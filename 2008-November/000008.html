<PRE>On state:

I am still in favor of having a settings member attribute in the
core.translator base_class. settings should be a dictiohnary, not an
int like state in version 1.0. Some settings may modify the behavior
of the translator such as which ruletable to load, how to encode the
output or whatever (these are just dummy examples). More importantly,
settings could contain a number of variables specific to the subclass
and rule table. So application developers should write extensions to
core.translator. These extensions add handler methods corresponding to
the rule types in the xml table. In other words: the authors of
xmltables need to be aware of the available rule handlers and the
settings related thereto. Your state concept is really worth
generalizing in the described way. So translators could count word
frequencies etc. The xml table could function much like a programming
language. This is what drove me to think about awt and how far we
should go with these xml tables.

On spring

The homepage looks interesting. Too complicated for me though. And I
think spring is unnecessary for such a tiny though smart project. Too
much overhead to be paid for the elegance gained.

On calling handler methods:

Although I am not too deeply into the anatomy of python objects on the
heap, I understand that while calling a particular method in a huge
class hierarchy can be expensive as the interpeter has to run through
a long chain of references plus dictionary look-ups etc.

However, I understand that all these costs can be avoided by using a
dictionary that maps node tags (= rule types) to handler methods. No
reference chain is there, as the reference to the method is itself
contained in the dictionary. So mydict[mykey] is the method object!
You see my point?

How to populate this dispatcher dict?

Well, I think core.translator could provide a populate_handler_dict
method by inspecting the list of attributes. We could agree on a
naming convention: each attribute named _RH_XYZ could be a handler
method for the node of type XYZ. You see my point? Then you have a
dict self.handlers. If the iterator finds a node with tag XYZ, it can
call the handler through self.handlers[XYZ.tag] or something. Each
handler takes the complete node and works on its attributes and on the
contents of self.settings.

What should core.translator export?
- settings
- handlers (just the dict as described)
- an apply method taking a string and a settings dict overriding any
existing settings
- a split_into_chunks method to be called by apply and overridden bn
by subclasses
- a poplulate_handlers method (see above)
- maybe some more, but no rules, as not each implementation will need
rules. Think of the simplest  case of a CSV file being a list of
(input, output) pairs where translation amounts to a blunt binary
search...


What should implementations do?
- add handler_methods, if needed
- load rule tables in whatsoever format
- override a method called by apply to process a chunk
- walk over the nodes and call the handler methods using the handlers
dict initially populated
- and much much more

 That's my initial view on architecture. Happy to discuss.
