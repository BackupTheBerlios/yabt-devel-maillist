<PRE>Hello,
I am trying to get up to date with my emails.

Setuptools:
My reasoning of setuptools over distutils:
* Setuptools can manage dependencies for YABT (if any). If YABT was to 
be split into YABT.core and an implementation(s), then the 
implementation(s) will require YABT.core if they are distributed in 
separate egg files. Also this assists developers using YABT for a task 
in their applications (eg. if I structured BrlTex correct to use 
setuptools then it could add YABT as a dependency).
* Setuptools and plugins for setuptools can provide file tracking. I 
mean that you don't need to create the manifest file to specify 
additional files to be included in source distributions, so long as they 
exist in the repository then setuptools (or for mercurial the 
hg.setuptools plug in) will automatically create the manifest file for you.
* version management. Setuptools will allow multiple version of YABT to 
be installed and the correct version to be used in applications.
* Entry points to support plugins. This feature allows developers to 
specify entry points in their egg files and setuptools automatically 
manages this. See how hg.setuptools is done as a plugin for setuptools, 
it only requires the user to install hg.setuptools for setuptools to 
support mercurial repositories (no configuration required).

I am sure that there may be other advantages I have just missed. I also 
will admit setuptools does have its problems (no obvious way to 
uninstall packages, etc) so I am willing to look at alternatives if 
anyone can suggest better.

Now for those versioning questions:
Forest looks like it would solve YABT's requirements, but I still have 
some questions in my mind as to how or what things are for (eg. does the 
server need the forest extension, does every person using the repository 
need the forest extension, what happens if they don't have it if it is 
needed, what are the snapshot files for, etc). The other thing is that 
on the forest extension's page there is a link to a proposal for adding 
module support to mercurial. Unfortunately there is no clue as to when 
this might happen. An interesting thing I do notice is that git does 
seem to have a submodules system, might we be better served by git 
(there is a git setuptools plugin)? It also comes back to the question, 
should YABT.core be a separate egg to a YABT implementation made by the 
YABT project? Creating it as one egg does solve the issue of mercurial 
and the separation can still be achieved with python packages inside one 
egg, but separating into different packages would show how 
implementations should be done by external developers.

As for naming the implementation packages, I selected YABT.braille as I 
want somewhere YABT to be obvious as to what it can be used for, rather 
than a library which looks so arbitary you can't really work out what it 
does. May be I was skipping a layer when thinking this, the people 
deciding to use a YABT implementation is not a end user, but a developer 
who hopefully can understand what YABT's potential is and doesn't need 
uses spelling out. Those developers using YABT in their application are 
the ones making YABT fit a users actual needs.

I feel some of these distribution questions should be answered before 
progressing with YABT (except for making that YABT-2.0b2 release) as if 
a restructure of the repository is needed I don't want to have to do it 
in the midst of developing YABT and potentially having work flow 
severely disrupted.
