<PRE>OK, I will discuss the speech use first, as it is the easier one to discuss.

Yes what you said is valid, it could do translation to phonems, but what 
I had imagined was that it could handle things like punctuation level, 
abreviations (eg. Dr. being doctor, Mr being Mister, etc being etcetera, 
etc)). That was just my thought but if it would be better as text to 
phonem then that could be the goal or even another goal, that's how 
flexible I want YABT to be.

That was too easy, I have another question first, how version numbers 
are to be done? Previously I was using the SVN revision number to define 
development versions, but setuptools can't get mercurial revision 
numbers. I have for the time set it to use date rather than revision 
number. This is good except it wouldn't show any difference between two 
development versions on the same day if multiple commits were made. A 
possible answer is hgversion which can work out the version number 
according to repository information (base version eg. 2.0b2 would be 
worked out from the previous tag in the repository (or PKG_INFO if in 
source distribution rather than repository). The only problem with this 
is if YABT splits into YABT.cor and YABT.braille and both are in one 
repository then both would need same base number (IE. one is updated and 
released both recieve version number move). May be we could use 
hgversion but customise it so that base version needs to be specified. I 
am possibly tempted by the date option as this is repository independent 
(IE. version numbering will not change should YABT move to another 
version control system).

Now for the difficult stuff. Before saying what YABT.core should offer, 
is this separation definitely going to be a good idea?

I can very much imagine what YABT.core would be in java, mainly 
interfaces, a few translator classes, some common rule types and 
probably a configuration module for retrieving the translator class and 
loading the rules via the correct loader. May be configuration could be 
provided through a configuration file like the spring framework. Its not 
quite so clear in python as interfaces don't actually exist, may be 
using python 2.6's abstract base classes instead. The only concern I 
have with python 2.6 is that psyco is not yet compiled for python 2.6 on 
windows (where pre-compiled packages are most important). This is why I 
have persisted with using python 2.5.

I get the feeling that a loader depends heavily on the rule 
implementations, but I feel that the translator classes should only need 
to know it is a rule. The concept is that the translator knows how to 
ask the rule/rule set to check whether it has a match, but the 
translator should not know how the rule has done that match. An existing 
expample is the current YABT Braille rules check group and state all in 
one go by looking it up in a dictionary (group and state are tuples in 
the keys of the dictionary). An alternative way to implement this is to 
have a rule set which checks group, and that rule set contains rule sets 
which check state (IE. 2 layers of checking). For this case it seems 
that the dictionary look up in one step is quicker. This dictionary look 
up system may not work for all cases, eg. if you had a tree structure 
which could contain varying length routes along branches (IE. to reach 
some rules you may only do 1 check, but for others you may do 5 checks). 
This is why I don't want to use ElementTree as the interface, and would 
rather have something like the current rule interface with its isMatch 
method. If there is to be an ElementTree implementation isMatch may just 
use the handlers on the nodes (unfortunately in python this may have a 
performance impact as calling methods can cost time, unlike java which 
knows the method actually exists so doesn't have to check for the 
method). May be ElementTree could lower the loader dependence on 
particular rule implementations, but I feel it would restrict how YABT 
could be used for developing alternative algorithms, hence ElementTree 
should be only one implementation.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way: another example of translation (maybe you meant this)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Happy to discuss.
