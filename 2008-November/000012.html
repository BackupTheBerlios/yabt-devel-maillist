<PRE>Hello,
I really want to get YABT-2.0b2 pushed out. It shouldn't change much 
from what it is. It really is a marker point in development.

Particular points up for discussion/action:
* That XML format... I feel it could be improved so much. particular 
points for alteration are:
input class - Should this be an element? I feel this could become an 
attribute of rule. Also should I remove the limit of input class being 
just an int? Initial reason was done in YABT-1.0 for performance, but we 
now are doing less state checks so performance impact should be less now.
final state - The same questions as input class.
Context types - should the context type name become an attribute of the 
context elements (bfcontext and afcontext)? This then removes the 2 
character limit for type names, and names could be more meaningful, eg. 
always instead of ^a.

As for the question of supporting control characters like form feed, my 
mind is not settled on that. Whilst things like form feed should really 
be the responsibility of applications, what about lazy text translation 
systems such as YABT_translate command? Also more importantly, I feel 
that context strings should support these control characters, as whilst 
the controlling app may handle the actual form feed, it possibly would 
want to tell YABT this translation happens at the end of a page. Whether 
the braille code (or other translation) actually has any differentce 
should not be of any concern to the application.

My feeling is that the XML change should happen, whether before or after 
YABT-2.0b2 I don't mind.
