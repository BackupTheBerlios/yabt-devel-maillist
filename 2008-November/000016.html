<PRE>The only possible changes I would want to make to YABT-2.0b2 excluding 
XML stuff is descriptions for YABT in the setup file. Currently it is 
very Braille specific eg. YABT (Yet another braille translator) is the 
short description and the long description is equally bBraille 
orientated only hinting at other uses.

If I was to permit XML changes (keeping backward compatability) would be 
to add an include statement, but I don't know at this moment how much 
work it might take to really implement it. As time is unknown, I would 
give it the thumbs down for YABT-2.0b2.

I am fairly certain on the XML limitation. I asked someone I know about 
it, I did a google search and for the version of XML the python parsers 
support it just won't take it. It isn't UTF8 characters which are the 
problem, its these control characters in ASCII (eg. form feed, there are 
others but this is one I really know about) and some other unicode 
characters not used much. This is a limitation of the XML version used, 
it is fixed by other XML versions (I mean by XML versions the actual XML 
specification as defined at the top of documents eg.
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;
not the languages implementation of parsers). The only fixes I could 
find suggested online were to use a child element as I have, use the 
newer version of XML (except python doesn't support this) or create some 
internal mark up (eg. the python \uXXXX notation in unicode strings). I 
opted for the child element as this then fitted with XML notation. If 
you need convincing about this lack of support, try creating XML using 
the DOM packages (eg. minidom) and then use the toxml method to create 
the XML string and then parse that, it will fail if you inserted a form 
feed when creating a #text node in forming the original DOM.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I really want to get YABT-2.0b2 pushed out. It shouldn't change much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from what it is. It really is a marker point in development.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Particular points up for discussion/action:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * That XML format... I feel it could be improved so much. particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> points for alteration are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input class - Should this be an element? I feel this could become an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attribute of rule. Also should I remove the limit of input class being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just an int? Initial reason was done in YABT-1.0 for performance, but we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now are doing less state checks so performance impact should be less now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> final state - The same questions as input class.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Context types - should the context type name become an attribute of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> context elements (bfcontext and afcontext)? This then removes the 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> character limit for type names, and names could be more meaningful, eg.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always instead of ^a.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for the question of supporting control characters like form feed, my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mind is not settled on that. Whilst things like form feed should really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be the responsibility of applications, what about lazy text translation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems such as YABT_translate command? Also more importantly, I feel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that context strings should support these control characters, as whilst
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the controlling app may handle the actual form feed, it possibly would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to tell YABT this translation happens at the end of a page. Whether
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the braille code (or other translation) actually has any differentce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should not be of any concern to the application.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My feeling is that the XML change should happen, whether before or after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> YABT-2.0b2 I don't mind.
