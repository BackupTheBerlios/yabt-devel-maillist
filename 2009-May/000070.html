<PRE>On abc: don't know what this should be good for. Maybe I don't see merit in
this because I don't know Java. My feeling is Java programming should be
restricted by government for it tends to cause obsessions. Well, there may
be an esthetic aspect I do not currently see. - Seriously: How about
Pythonic duck typing or, if you are really really fond of type-checking:
function annotations? Other than that: isinstance(), bases() etc. do a good
job, I think. I personally do not understand abc anyway. But feel free to go
for it.

Nice, your api ideas.

My main concern, as you know, is an extensible set of node types. I would
really really suggest to have a look at ElementTree or, even better, lxml,
the latter, of course, creating a dependency.

I don't know why 2.5 or earlier should be supported. When it is ready, 2.5
will be long ago. P3.0 support would seem imparative.

Betreff: [Yabt-devel] Work for YABT 3.0


Hello,
I am going to start on YABT 3.0 (I really need to just spend some time
on YABT so I get back into the flow of working on it, I think). Before I
do, I have a couple of questions (I feel now is best to ask as there
could be some major changes in YABT and so other changes may be more
possible):

* I really want to set some interfaces/abstract classes for those who
may want to create alternatives. May be this comes from my java side,
but python's abstract base classes added in python 2.6 should give me
what I want. How much call is there for the various python versions? I
am particularly interested in whether there is any need for support
before python 2.6.
* Linked with the first point, how important is low dependency on other
python packages? I ideally want to keep YABT as self contained as
possible to maintain the ability to have YABT supported on as many
platforms as possible and also to make it easier to switch to python 3.0
(may be even have python 3.0 support in YABT 3.0 from the beginning).
How ever I don't intend to do this at the expense of having to re-event
the wheel, so should an external package work well or be important I
will depend on it.
* I plan to rework some of how YABT does its translation (IE. how the
rules actually work and so different translation tables will be needed).
I will look back over some of the ideas. I hope it will be better, but I
can't say exactly at the moment how it will look.
* I intend a high level API, again no fixed plan yet, but ideally for an
application using YABT it should be something like:
 &gt;&gt;&gt; YABT.listTranslators()
   [{&quot;input&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;output&quot;: &quot;Braille UK&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Text to UK
Braille&quot;}, {&quot;input&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;output&quot;: &quot;Speech UK&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Text
to UK speech&quot;}]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; translator = YABT.getTranslator(input=&quot;text&quot;, output=&quot;Braille UK&quot;)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; translator.listStates()
   [&quot;Grade1&quot;, &quot;Grade2&quot;, &quot;Computer Braille&quot;]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; translator.translate(&quot;Hello world&quot;, &quot;Grade2&quot;, &quot; &quot;, &quot; &quot;)
   &quot;,HELLO _W&quot;
 &gt;&gt;&gt;

(actual final running may differ as this raises questions in my mind,
eg. looks like the above would do auto scanning of tables to suggest
what translations can occur, how might one add an extra table, what if
two translators equally meet a getTranslator call criteria, etc). The
lower level API should still be available (fairly close to YABT 2.0 but
there will certainly be some alterations).

Any extra comments/changes you would like to make/see?

Michael Whapples
