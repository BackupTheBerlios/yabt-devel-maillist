<PRE>Hello,
I am going to start on YABT 3.0 (I really need to just spend some time 
on YABT so I get back into the flow of working on it, I think). Before I 
do, I have a couple of questions (I feel now is best to ask as there 
could be some major changes in YABT and so other changes may be more 
possible):

* I really want to set some interfaces/abstract classes for those who 
may want to create alternatives. May be this comes from my java side, 
but python's abstract base classes added in python 2.6 should give me 
what I want. How much call is there for the various python versions? I 
am particularly interested in whether there is any need for support 
before python 2.6.
* Linked with the first point, how important is low dependency on other 
python packages? I ideally want to keep YABT as self contained as 
possible to maintain the ability to have YABT supported on as many 
platforms as possible and also to make it easier to switch to python 3.0 
(may be even have python 3.0 support in YABT 3.0 from the beginning). 
How ever I don't intend to do this at the expense of having to re-event 
the wheel, so should an external package work well or be important I 
will depend on it.
* I plan to rework some of how YABT does its translation (IE. how the 
rules actually work and so different translation tables will be needed). 
I will look back over some of the ideas. I hope it will be better, but I 
can't say exactly at the moment how it will look.
* I intend a high level API, again no fixed plan yet, but ideally for an 
application using YABT it should be something like:
 &gt;&gt;&gt; YABT.listTranslators()
   [{&quot;input&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;output&quot;: &quot;Braille UK&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Text to UK 
Braille&quot;}, {&quot;input&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;output&quot;: &quot;Speech UK&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Text 
to UK speech&quot;}]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; translator = YABT.getTranslator(input=&quot;text&quot;, output=&quot;Braille UK&quot;)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; translator.listStates()
   [&quot;Grade1&quot;, &quot;Grade2&quot;, &quot;Computer Braille&quot;]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; translator.translate(&quot;Hello world&quot;, &quot;Grade2&quot;, &quot; &quot;, &quot; &quot;)
   &quot;,HELLO _W&quot;
 &gt;&gt;&gt;

(actual final running may differ as this raises questions in my mind, 
eg. looks like the above would do auto scanning of tables to suggest 
what translations can occur, how might one add an extra table, what if 
two translators equally meet a getTranslator call criteria, etc). The 
lower level API should still be available (fairly close to YABT 2.0 but 
there will certainly be some alterations).

Any extra comments/changes you would like to make/see?

Michael Whapples
