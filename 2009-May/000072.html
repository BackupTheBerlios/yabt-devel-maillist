<PRE>Hello,
Before getting down to business I will just say again the java 
development tried to distract me so I'm going to attend to YABT before 
it does. I suppose we can just hope for Sun to set up a JA (java 
annonymous) in my area, until that happens I may just need to 
occasionally feed the java habbit. At the moment I have come across JNA 
(java native access) which is like python's ctypes for java, although I 
feel more comfortable with JNA. I have started making liblouis java 
bindings using it (liblouis was a fairly simple but not trivial library 
to start with, I intend to possibly change my media PC to use java for 
the programming language).

Anyway down to business with YABT. I have started looking at changing 
YABT for 3.0, first thing is to remove that addCharacterMap method from 
the translator class and anything to do with it. This though raises the 
question of how to neatly deal with capitalisation (which is the reason 
for making the change). My proposals are:

* Use a custom object to represent the translation text. This object 
would have the string in lowercase and a list/array of flags (possibly 
as characters) representing the capitalisation of the character in that 
position in the string (eg. flags may say capital, lowercase, either 
case/no case, etc). Rules would use this object for matching. Flags may 
not need to be limited to just capitalisation information, so this has 
scope for future expansion. However it may be fiddly for surrounding 
matching (eg. with regular expressions) as the string part is case 
insensitive and the case may be wanted, it would require additional 
manual checking of the case.
* Alternatively to the above (possibly my preferred) is for the 
translation text object to contain two copies of the text, one in 
lowercase (eg. created by the lowercase function of python) and another 
string being the original (so containing all the capitals, etc). This is 
simpler for checking as the rule uses whichever string it wants to.

Neither of the above will fully achieve what I want, adding the rules to 
ensure capital signs are inserted where needed may require many rules to 
get every situation, therefore I propose a zero length focus rule type. 
These zero length rules would be checked first and should one match then 
it may insert into the output but focus position will not be moved on in 
the translation text, and then the standard rules are checked. This will 
avoid me having to make the translator do something specific around 
capitals, only rules need to be defined (what I mean is that liblouis 
requires a capsign and such like to be defined in its tables but this is 
awfully Braille specific as to when it should be used, YABT would allow 
the rule to say when it should be used).

I had a brief look back through my email and found a message where you 
described a way possibly to do translation (infact two suggestions of 
algorithms), this message is below. Out of the two I can imagine the 
second better (I can almost imagine the code or at least the general 
code structure). One question I have with this second algorithm is how 
does it determine order of exceptions should we have more than one 
exception of the same focus (eg. if focus is &quot;sh&quot; and we may have 
exception saying &quot;sh&quot; followed by &quot;ead&quot; should be output as &quot;sh&quot; and 
&quot;sh&quot; followed by anything else should be &quot;%&quot; (sh sign) (example may not 
actually come to be if table was designed right but it gives the idea)). 
Would this be expected to be order specific as very few will be in such 
a situation and the ordering problem was to do with the huge number of 
rules needing the correct order in the current YABT table system?

The first one my questions are things like:

* How do you determine what is the longest focus to start with?
* If previous question answer is that it should be until the end of a 
word, how do we deal with spaces, multi-word contractions (eg. &quot;in to 
the&quot;), etc.

My earlier proposal not published on this list was as follows:
At the first level of the tree there are only rules checking for the 
length of the original (i.e. substring to be translated by a single 
contraction). So there are likely nor more than 5 to 10 nodes. On the 
second level I suggested rules checking for the beginning or the end of 
the word to single out contractions that may apply under such 
circumstances. But as most contractions can occur anywhere, this 
wouldn't reduce the problem very much. For the third level I suggested 
to check in alphabetical order if the substring matches any of the 
originals in the nodes. If so, the contraction may be used unless some 
excemption contained in the subtree of that contraction applies.
Today, an alternative algorithm came to my mind and I want to quickly 
expose the idea so it is retained:
We sort all contractions alphabetically using the original (eg: &quot;that&quot; 
or &quot;sh&quot;). We arrange them in the tree as follows: At the first level 
(i.e. root's children) each node corresponds to the first character of 
the originals. So there are around 26 nodes. The contraction for 
&quot;always&quot; will occur in the first node, &quot;but and because in the second 
and so forth. At level 2 we distinguish according to the second char of 
the original. Here, we are likely to have much less nodes as, e.g. there 
are no contractions whose original starts with &quot;aa&quot; or &quot;jk&quot;. The depth 
of the tree is equal to the length of the longest original. Walking 
through the input string char by char will guide us to the longest 
contraction which might apply. The subtree of that contraction may then 
contain exemptions such as with &quot;gateshead&quot;. If an exemption applies, 
there may still be a shorter contraction encountered on our way up to 
here. So we'll have to backtrack and check if that one applies.
At a given level, each node must be checked until the char matches. This 
may take long if the current letter is &quot;z&quot;. To speed up things, one may 
consider binary search in cases where there are many nodes. Another 
option is to assemble the chars in each node to a string functioning as 
an index to the nodes of each level. The index string for level 1 is 
likely to contain the entire alphabet. At level 2, most strings will 
have much less characters. Choosing the right node comes down to 
searching the position where the character occurs in the index string.
I don't know if this algorithm is smarter than the previous one. Its 
downside might be that it disregards the context until a specific 
contraction is singled out. In most cases, however, the described 
iterative matching may yield good approximations.
We may reconsider both alternatives when discussing which node types to 
implement.
