<PRE>My reasoning on wanting the ABC functionality is that its a good way to 
write down the API and try and ensure that anyone wanting to make an 
alternative implementation will follow the API. Possibly what I really 
want is interfaces but python has ABCs which are close enough. Also may 
be there is a greater need and greater benefits in Java to having 
interfaces and abstract classes. While I won't be doing too much type 
checking, it does help in python for duck typing as its something which 
may contain no implementation details which all classes implementing a 
certain API can inherit from (in the python 2.6 what's new section it 
gives examples of file like objects, iterable objects, etc, they need 
not have a common implementation super type, just a type to say they 
provide that method, which should developers absolutely need to check 
the type they can check for).

As I said how rules will actually work (as in how they will consider 
whether to be applied or not) has not yet been decided and I will look 
into all that has been said. I may just make some very basic example 
rules (eg. word substitution initially to confirm that the API works).

</I>&gt;<i> Betreff: [Yabt-devel] Work for YABT 3.0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I am going to start on YABT 3.0 (I really need to just spend some time
</I>&gt;<i> on YABT so I get back into the flow of working on it, I think). Before I
</I>&gt;<i> do, I have a couple of questions (I feel now is best to ask as there
</I>&gt;<i> could be some major changes in YABT and so other changes may be more
</I>&gt;<i> possible):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I really want to set some interfaces/abstract classes for those who
</I>&gt;<i> may want to create alternatives. May be this comes from my java side,
</I>&gt;<i> but python's abstract base classes added in python 2.6 should give me
</I>&gt;<i> what I want. How much call is there for the various python versions? I
</I>&gt;<i> am particularly interested in whether there is any need for support
</I>&gt;<i> before python 2.6.
</I>&gt;<i> * Linked with the first point, how important is low dependency on other
</I>&gt;<i> python packages? I ideally want to keep YABT as self contained as
</I>&gt;<i> possible to maintain the ability to have YABT supported on as many
</I>&gt;<i> platforms as possible and also to make it easier to switch to python 3.0
</I>&gt;<i> (may be even have python 3.0 support in YABT 3.0 from the beginning).
</I>&gt;<i> How ever I don't intend to do this at the expense of having to re-event
</I>&gt;<i> the wheel, so should an external package work well or be important I
</I>&gt;<i> will depend on it.
</I>&gt;<i> * I plan to rework some of how YABT does its translation (IE. how the
</I>&gt;<i> rules actually work and so different translation tables will be needed).
</I>&gt;<i> I will look back over some of the ideas. I hope it will be better, but I
</I>&gt;<i> can't say exactly at the moment how it will look.
</I>&gt;<i> * I intend a high level API, again no fixed plan yet, but ideally for an
</I>&gt;<i> application using YABT it should be something like:
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;&gt;&gt;  YABT.listTranslators()
</I>&gt;<i>     [{&quot;input&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;output&quot;: &quot;Braille UK&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Text to UK
</I>&gt;<i> Braille&quot;}, {&quot;input&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;output&quot;: &quot;Speech UK&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Text
</I>&gt;<i> to UK speech&quot;}]
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;&gt;&gt;  translator = YABT.getTranslator(input=&quot;text&quot;, output=&quot;Braille UK&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;&gt;&gt;  translator.listStates()
</I>&gt;<i>     [&quot;Grade1&quot;, &quot;Grade2&quot;, &quot;Computer Braille&quot;]
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;&gt;&gt;  translator.translate(&quot;Hello world&quot;, &quot;Grade2&quot;, &quot; &quot;, &quot; &quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;,HELLO _W&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (actual final running may differ as this raises questions in my mind,
</I>&gt;<i> eg. looks like the above would do auto scanning of tables to suggest
</I>&gt;<i> what translations can occur, how might one add an extra table, what if
</I>&gt;<i> two translators equally meet a getTranslator call criteria, etc). The
</I>&gt;<i> lower level API should still be available (fairly close to YABT 2.0 but
</I>&gt;<i> there will certainly be some alterations).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any extra comments/changes you would like to make/see?
