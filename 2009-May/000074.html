<PRE>Hello,
My plan with rule exceptions is that if we can decend another level 
because we can match another character then we do decend. Once we cannot 
decend further it looks through the applicable substitutions at that 
level. Should none of these match then we retreat a level and look at 
the substitutions there. Substitutions at a given level are what have 
been referred to as exceptions, but I used the term substitution as it 
could be the naturally expected for some levels (IE. at the deepest we 
can decend and there may only be the one, it relates as an exception as 
we can't decend further).

As for choosing particular options and how it may affect performance, as 
I said in the past I want to try and keep performance reasonable and so 
should be kept in mind (EG. YABT using psyco to optimise performance at 
the moment takes about 8 seconds on my computer to translate the report 
on BrailleTrans (converted to text using pdftotext, approx 150 pages) 
where as liblouis takes under a second). Yes I think YABT and liblouis 
have very different goals so possibly the performance hit of using YABT 
is worth it but it is quite a significant difference in translation 
time. Trying to optimise a few obvious things at the beginning (IE. not 
repeating actions which you know you don't need to repeat, within a call 
of translate the translation text will not change so any conversion to 
lowercase only need happen once) I think is worth trying to design from 
the beginning (string operations can be expensive, particularly on long 
strings).

As for J stuff, JNA isn't a waste of time, as I said I plan to use it in 
my media PC, liblouis was simply something simple to try out JNA before 
I start work on the more complicated library for the keypad and LCD 
display of the PC. Also JNA as I said is preferable to me than ctypes, 
it does feel more natural to use. Anyway as far as things go YABT is 
python and python it will stay, YABT doesn't need either ctypes or JNA. 
The only thing I will add is I have heard some people suggest that java 
programmers prefer ruby rather than python, better keep me away from 
ruby then.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>     Before getting down to business I will just say again the java
</I>&gt;<i>     development tried to distract me so I'm going to attend to YABT
</I>&gt;<i>     before it does. I suppose we can just hope for Sun to set up a JA
</I>&gt;<i>     (java annonymous) in my area, until that happens I may just need
</I>&gt;<i>     to occasionally feed the java habbit. At the moment I have come
</I>&gt;<i>     across JNA (java native access) which is like python's ctypes for
</I>&gt;<i>     java, although I feel more comfortable with JNA. I have started
</I>&gt;<i>     making liblouis java bindings using it (liblouis was a fairly
</I>&gt;<i>     simple but not trivial library to start with, I intend to possibly
</I>&gt;<i>     change my media PC to use java for the programming language).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Anyway down to business with YABT. I have started looking at
</I>&gt;<i>     changing YABT for 3.0, first thing is to remove that
</I>&gt;<i>     addCharacterMap method from the translator class and anything to
</I>&gt;<i>     do with it. This though raises the question of how to neatly deal
</I>&gt;<i>     with capitalisation (which is the reason for making the change).
</I>&gt;<i>     My proposals are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * Use a custom object to represent the translation text. This
</I>&gt;<i>     object would have the string in lowercase and a list/array of
</I>&gt;<i>     flags (possibly as characters) representing the capitalisation of
</I>&gt;<i>     the character in that position in the string (eg. flags may say
</I>&gt;<i>     capital, lowercase, either case/no case, etc). Rules would use
</I>&gt;<i>     this object for matching. Flags may not need to be limited to just
</I>&gt;<i>     capitalisation information, so this has scope for future
</I>&gt;<i>     expansion. However it may be fiddly for surrounding matching (eg.
</I>&gt;<i>     with regular expressions) as the string part is case insensitive
</I>&gt;<i>     and the case may be wanted, it would require additional manual
</I>&gt;<i>     checking of the case.
</I>&gt;<i>     * Alternatively to the above (possibly my preferred) is for the
</I>&gt;<i>     translation text object to contain two copies of the text, one in
</I>&gt;<i>     lowercase (eg. created by the lowercase function of python) and
</I>&gt;<i>     another string being the original (so containing all the capitals,
</I>&gt;<i>     etc). This is simpler for checking as the rule uses whichever
</I>&gt;<i>     string it wants to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Neither of the above will fully achieve what I want, adding the
</I>&gt;<i>     rules to ensure capital signs are inserted where needed may
</I>&gt;<i>     require many rules to get every situation, therefore I propose a
</I>&gt;<i>     zero length focus rule type. These zero length rules would be
</I>&gt;<i>     checked first and should one match then it may insert into the
</I>&gt;<i>     output but focus position will not be moved on in the translation
</I>&gt;<i>     text, and then the standard rules are checked. This will avoid me
</I>&gt;<i>     having to make the translator do something specific around
</I>&gt;<i>     capitals, only rules need to be defined (what I mean is that
</I>&gt;<i>     liblouis requires a capsign and such like to be defined in its
</I>&gt;<i>     tables but this is awfully Braille specific as to when it should
</I>&gt;<i>     be used, YABT would allow the rule to say when it should be used).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I had a brief look back through my email and found a message where
</I>&gt;<i>     you described a way possibly to do translation (infact two
</I>&gt;<i>     suggestions of algorithms), this message is below. Out of the two
</I>&gt;<i>     I can imagine the second better (I can almost imagine the code or
</I>&gt;<i>     at least the general code structure). One question I have with
</I>&gt;<i>     this second algorithm is how does it determine order of exceptions
</I>&gt;<i>     should we have more than one exception of the same focus (eg. if
</I>&gt;<i>     focus is &quot;sh&quot; and we may have exception saying &quot;sh&quot; followed by
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;ead&quot; should be output as &quot;sh&quot; and &quot;sh&quot; followed by anything else
</I>&gt;<i>     should be &quot;%&quot; (sh sign) (example may not actually come to be if
</I>&gt;<i>     table was designed right but it gives the idea)). Would this be
</I>&gt;<i>     expected to be order specific as very few will be in such a
</I>&gt;<i>     situation and the ordering problem was to do with the huge number
</I>&gt;<i>     of rules needing the correct order in the current YABT table system?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The first one my questions are things like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * How do you determine what is the longest focus to start with?
</I>&gt;<i>     * If previous question answer is that it should be until the end
</I>&gt;<i>     of a word, how do we deal with spaces, multi-word contractions
</I>&gt;<i>     (eg. &quot;in to the&quot;), etc.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My earlier proposal not published on this list was as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>     At the first level of the tree there are only rules checking for
</I>&gt;<i>     the length of the original (i.e. substring to be translated by a
</I>&gt;<i>     single contraction). So there are likely nor more than 5 to 10
</I>&gt;<i>     nodes. On the second level I suggested rules checking for the
</I>&gt;<i>     beginning or the end of the word to single out contractions that
</I>&gt;<i>     may apply under such circumstances. But as most contractions can
</I>&gt;<i>     occur anywhere, this wouldn't reduce the problem very much. For
</I>&gt;<i>     the third level I suggested to check in alphabetical order if the
</I>&gt;<i>     substring matches any of the originals in the nodes. If so, the
</I>&gt;<i>     contraction may be used unless some excemption contained in the
</I>&gt;<i>     subtree of that contraction applies.
</I>&gt;<i>     Today, an alternative algorithm came to my mind and I want to
</I>&gt;<i>     quickly expose the idea so it is retained:
</I>&gt;<i>     We sort all contractions alphabetically using the original (eg:
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;that&quot; or &quot;sh&quot;). We arrange them in the tree as follows: At the
</I>&gt;<i>     first level (i.e. root's children) each node corresponds to the
</I>&gt;<i>     first character of the originals. So there are around 26 nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>     The contraction for &quot;always&quot; will occur in the first node, &quot;but
</I>&gt;<i>     and because in the second and so forth. At level 2 we distinguish
</I>&gt;<i>     according to the second char of the original. Here, we are likely
</I>&gt;<i>     to have much less nodes as, e.g. there are no contractions whose
</I>&gt;<i>     original starts with &quot;aa&quot; or &quot;jk&quot;. The depth of the tree is equal
</I>&gt;<i>     to the length of the longest original. Walking through the input
</I>&gt;<i>     string char by char will guide us to the longest contraction which
</I>&gt;<i>     might apply. The subtree of that contraction may then contain
</I>&gt;<i>     exemptions such as with &quot;gateshead&quot;. If an exemption applies,
</I>&gt;<i>     there may still be a shorter contraction encountered on our way up
</I>&gt;<i>     to here. So we'll have to backtrack and check if that one applies.
</I>&gt;<i>     At a given level, each node must be checked until the char
</I>&gt;<i>     matches. This may take long if the current letter is &quot;z&quot;. To speed
</I>&gt;<i>     up things, one may consider binary search in cases where there are
</I>&gt;<i>     many nodes. Another option is to assemble the chars in each node
</I>&gt;<i>     to a string functioning as an index to the nodes of each level.
</I>&gt;<i>     The index string for level 1 is likely to contain the entire
</I>&gt;<i>     alphabet. At level 2, most strings will have much less characters.
</I>&gt;<i>     Choosing the right node comes down to searching the position where
</I>&gt;<i>     the character occurs in the index string.
</I>&gt;<i>     I don't know if this algorithm is smarter than the previous one.
</I>&gt;<i>     Its downside might be that it disregards the context until a
</I>&gt;<i>     specific contraction is singled out. In most cases, however, the
</I>&gt;<i>     described iterative matching may yield good approximations.
</I>&gt;<i>     We may reconsider both alternatives when discussing which node
</I>&gt;<i>     types to implement.
