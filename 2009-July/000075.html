<PRE>Hello,
I am pleased to announce the addition of a translation table which will 
produce the dot patterns according to the unicode Braille character set 
(IE. those characters in the range \u2800 to \u28ff). This table should 
be exactly the same as the britishtobrl.xml file except for the output 
being unicode Braille. This table can now be found in the mercurial 
repository. I would recommend installing YABT from the mercurial 
repository as well as it has some slight alterations in the yabt-trans 
command which helps use the new table, although the table will work with 
older versions of YABT. The reason I recommend updating to the version 
in mercurial is that it adds an encoding option (either -e or 
--encoding) to the yabt-trans command so that it can output unicode, 
older versions will just use python's default encoding and so might 
cause unicode errors.

So why use unicode Braille?

* Unicode Braille characters actually represent dot patterns and 
anything which uses unicode Braille will always have the correct dot 
pattern for the character. This contrasts to standards like ascii 
Braille (sometimes known as North American Braille computer code) which 
requires the correct table to be used to achieve the correct dot 
pattern. Essentially unicode Braille does what unicode is meant to, 
remove all the reliance on correct encodings being used.
* Software like brltty and libbraille can use unicode Braille, so taking 
all the advantages of the first point.
* Unicode Braille can be used to display dot patterns in a visual form 
on screen. Please ensure that when doing this you have a suitable font 
installed on your system (eg. the dejavu font which can be got from 
<A HREF="http://dejavu.sf.net">http://dejavu.sf.net</A>).
* possibly other reasons I am unaware of...

When might you not want unicode Braille?
While I feel there are very good reasons for using unicode Braille, 
there may be times it is not appropriate to use it, so I have left the 
standard britishtobrl.xml file. Below are some reasons why you might 
want ascii Braille instead of unicode Braille.

* Some devices and software may not support unicode Braille directly (I 
don't know much about which devices will or will not support it, I know 
that my ALVA Braille display used through brltty or libbraille will 
support unicode Braille, but I couldn't say about Braille displays used 
through other software and I won't even guess about embossers).
* If you don't have a suitable font then unicode Braille won't make much 
sense and so unusable. Ascii Braille only uses ascii characters and so 
doesn't need special fonts and as some people are familiar with ascii 
Braille they can read the plain ascii text used for ascii Braille (even 
though it may not be as natural as they would like).

If you do decide to try out this new table then please provide feedback 
as this table was produced using a small automated tool and so might not 
work quite as I expected. Also if others have developed other tables and 
would like access to this tool, I can add it to the YABT mercurial 
repository (I haven't at the moment as it was a quick knocked together 
program and doesn't perform much in the way of error checks.

Michael Whapples
